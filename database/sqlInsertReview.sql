I''ve been out of the film loop recently, but word of this disaster even reached me. I had to check it out for myself to get it watched before I got spoiled. Sometimes the internet piles in to jointly overhate a movie... this is not one of those times.



What a mess, there are sadly no redeeming qualities to it. First and foremost, it takes itself way too seriously. There are (I think) a few jokes scattered in there, though they last for literal seconds - everything else is played straight. It had a better chance of working as a comedy, albeit barely.



The initial novelty of the "screenlife" (never knew that was a thing until now) set-up is kinda interesting, though it very quickly wears off completely. It ends up getting annoying, especially the constant calling noises - almost gave me a headache. It''d work as a short, not for 90mins!



The computer stuff looks quite awful too, the most boring and least creative way of utilizing the whole PC concept too. They literally just zoom in and out for the entire flick. There is one scene where they do the <em>''Jaws''</em> dolly zoom effect, which is minorly cool to be fair.



There is also a piece of photoshop right at the end that is hilariously bad, I''m pretty certain I could do a better job... OK, maybe not, but you know. The whole ending had me chuckling (negatively) at the film, with that aforementioned moment but also with that flying delivery thing.



I''ve got this far into this (overly long) review without noting the acting talent. It has a few good names attached, but null of them do anything remotely standout - but, in fairness, have barely anything to work with. You could place any world leading lad or lass in this and it''d be the same.



Ice Cube... I''m gonna let this one slide, because I do like him. Same goes for Eva Longoria. Both of ''em are, erm, not good though. The only actor I''d give a tiny solace of praise to would be Devon Bostick (Rodrick to you and I), who has one scene where his teary eyes look kinda convincing. As you can see, I''m reaching!



I don''t know what''s worse. This movie, or the fact that I''ve just typed up seven paragraphs about it. We''re both as bad as each other! This only avoids the bottom rating from yours truly through comparison. Incredibly, I have seen worse.');

Data! They''re coming for data. They''re going to eat all our data! Why not just copy the data? Why not just set up a separate server farm where they just make an infinite RickRoll for the aliens. There is technically unlimited data if you copy that data forever and if the aliens eat the data, does that mean there''s space for more data on that hdd? If you could write the read spead of the aliens, you could just give them unlimited data off of some small device. That could keep them eating for a while and while they''re distracted, you set up a nuclear bomb inside them that is on a timer and they could prevent it from going nuclear but doing so will cause them to sacrifice themselves for the greater good.

The problematic drawback with this technique lies in the fact it is like watching a live action video game and the unfolding drama surrounding the dilemmas and traumas the various characters we are supposed to care about are enduring quickly becomes desperately abstract as any global disaster inevitably does when it is reduced to being nothing more than television news feeds and the deceased are merely a list of numbers on a screen.

To add to his sleeplessness, his sister “Gwen” (also still Madeleine McGraw) is having some fairly torturous nightmares that, coupled with some sleep-walking, are unsettling both of them. Determined to find out what is causing these traumas, they hook up with her fellow Duran Duran fan “Ernesto” (Miguel Mora) and head to the very Christian fellowship camp where their mum was a counsellor.

The cold and frosty environment and half decent efforts from Thames and McGraw do help to keep this mystery rolling along, but despite some curious and menacing flashbacks that fill us in with what did and might happen, the story here just isn’t very solid or original. It takes far too long to get going, and the denouement - though quite action-packed, is all just too rushed and disappointing.

Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba – Infinity Castle is not just anime—it''s an art form in motion. Ufotable has once again shattered expectations, delivering what is arguably the greatest animation ever seen in anime history. Every frame of Infinity Castle is a painting. Every battle is a symphony of light, color, movement, and emotion.



The sheer scale of the Infinity Castle arc is staggering. Shifting gravity, kaleidoscopic architecture, and relentless pacing pull you into a world that feels boundless and terrifying. And through this madness, the animators create visual clarity and storytelling precision that defy logic. The fights aren’t just flashy—they’re intimate, brutal, and deeply emotional. You feel every breath, every strike, every sacrifice.



Tanjiro, Zenitsu, Inosuke, and the Hashira face impossible odds with a sense of weight and urgency that grips your chest. Character moments hit harder than ever. The Upper Moons are terrifying in both presence and power. And Muzan? An absolute force of dread.



What truly sets Infinity Castle apart isn’t just the spectacle—though it is unparalleled. It’s the way the animation serves the heart of the story. Loyalty, grief, fury, and love are painted across the screen with every cut, every cry, every flicker of a blade.



This is peak anime. A cultural milestone. A visual symphony.

Demon Slayer: Infinity Castle is what happens when anime dares to be legendary.

I watched it yesterday, and movies like this deserve no less than an IMAX experience.



Having said that, I walked out with a mixed experience. I felt that they tried to squeeze too many side stories in one movie. In the first 2/3 of the movie, you keep going back and forth from fight scenes to side stories, which breaks the tempo. It was not well executed, and I would have preferred if they just finished one side story and then come back to the fight scenes to finish it. Also, many side stories were finished in rush, which did not add much context of emotions.

This is probably the most grotesque take on the “Cinderella” story you are ever like to see, as it pretty graphically shows the life of this young girl, her stepsister, her mother and her downright cruel Svengali who thinks nothing of stitching her eyelids on or rearranging her teeth - without, of course, any anaesthetic.

Unfortunately, then, it’s frustrating when a film comes along that might help to shed some light on the subject but that leaves viewers not entirely clear what to make of it. Such is the case with this clumsily constructed offering from Oscar-winning director Kathryn Bigelow. The picture, told from different perspectives in three overlapping chapters, follows the developments associated with a single mysteriously launched nuclear missile headed for the US mainland and the efforts to determine who fired it and how it might be contained. The first chapter primarily chronicles the efforts of the military and the staff in the White House Situation Room. The second looks at the event from the perspective of Strategic Command. And the third follows the impossible decision-making process left in the hands of the President (Idris Elba). Over the course of these interlocking segments, viewers are introduced to the gut-wrenching issues thrust upon the Secretary of Defense (Jared Harris), the head of Strategic Command (Tracy Letts), the Deputy National Security Advisor (Gabriel Basso) and the Situation Room chief (Jason Clarke) as they attempt to sort out what to do, determinations that are fundamentally greater than any of them are capable of addressing realistically, let alone satisfactorily. It’s a frightening scenario, to be sure, as the missile comes ever closer to striking its target, Chicago, a calamity projected at killing upwards of 10 million. Regrettably, though, the format chosen to tell this story does little to clarify matters for audiences. Given the many characters and diverse locations involved in the narrative, as well as the pervasive jargon, numerous shorthand acronyms and underexplained policy options that pepper the needlessly complicated screenplay, one practically needs a scorecard or flow chart to keep everything straight, making the film more of a chore to watch than a vehicle designed to offer insight and enlightenment. Sadly, there are no winners in circumstances like this, and the picture, to its credit, makes that point abundantly clear. However, when it comes to leaving a hard-hitting, truly meaningful, scared-down-to-your-socks impact on those who watch this release, the goal is not achieved nearly as well as in any number of other offerings, such as “Fail Safe” (1964), “Dr. Strangelove” (1964), “WarGames” (1983), “The Day After” (1983) or “Threads” (1984), all of which make clearer, better defined viewing choices than this film. In the end, when it comes to the feasibility of engaging in nuclear gamesmanship, one can’t help but be enlightened by the astute observation presented in “WarGames,” the notion that “the only winning move is not to play,” a message that “A House of Dynamite” attempts to echo. It’s just unfortunate that it doesn’t do so nearly as well as its predecessor, particularly given the stakes involved.');

Well I was quite pleasantly surprised as it takes those foundations and, with it’s tongue firmly implanted in it’s cheek, and with him suitably armed with his newly radioactive mop, we set off on a crime caper with a difference. Kevin Bacon’s “Bob Garbinger” runs a big chemical company that routinely churns out enough gunge into the rivers and streams of the city to give Julia Roberts and Albert Finney enough work for a lifetime. “Winston” (Peter Dinklage) is trying to rear teenage stepson “Wade” (Jacob Tremblay) whilst holding down a menial job in one of those plants. When he gets a terrible diagnosis from his doctor, he thinks he has company health insurance - but when platinum turns out not to be all it’s cracked up to be, he decides to ask his boss to intercede. That just sees him rather savagely treated and dumped into a drain where, well let’s just say it isn’t envy that has turned him green. Meantime, we learn that all in his garden isn’t exactly rosy for “Garbinger” either, so with hoodlums chasing him and his wacky brother “Fritz” (Elijah Wood doing his best impersonation of “Gru”) organising a kid-napping it falls to the irritated “Toxie” to save the city, nobble the baddies, rescue “Wade” and maybe even stop his eye from constantly popping out of it’s socket on a great big stalk! This is quite an entertaining parody of many things super-hero with shades of Hammer and John Carpenter thrown into a mix that is held together amiably by a Dinklage who looks like he is enjoying himself. He even manages to rescue a cat! The scenario serves to remind us of just how cavalier we have been and still are with our environment in the name of convenience and though Bacon isn’t really at his best, he and his band of “Nuts” provide plenty to swing a pretty lethal sponge-on-stick at! High brow it isn’t, but when “Winston” discovers the astonishingly corrosive powers of his own wee…! Mindless and enjoyable, and I liked it in the end. Wouldn’t bet against a sequel.');

Somewhere in the cosmic video store of nostalgia, my 12-year-old self just did a cartwheel in parachute pants. I grew up rewinding the original Toxic Avenger on worn-out VHS until the tracking lines looked like snowstorms over Tromaville. So when Hollywood whispered “remake,” I braced myself for PG-13 sterilization and emotional damage. But bless Macon Blair’s radioactive heart—he didn’t just do it justice, he hosed it down in glowing sludge and handed it a mop.



Our new hero is Winston Gooze (Peter Dinklage), a terminally ill janitor who gets baptized in toxic goop and comes out looking like a meatball with abs and a Costco-sized case of trauma. Dinklage doesn’t just play Toxie, he owns him. He swings that glowing mop like Excalibur dipped in biohazard, and suddenly I remembered why deformed vigilantes matter: because nothing says “hero” like ripping someone’s intestines out while trying to make it to parent-teacher night.



And can we talk about the casting? Kevin Bacon as the corporate tyrant who drinks villain monologues for breakfast? Chef’s kiss. Elijah Wood pops up as his gremlin-esque brother, looking like he crawled out of a vat of expired hair dye and cryptid rumors swirling in the time warp. Their private death squad, the Killer Nutz, is less “elite mercenaries” and more “fetish convention meets meth carnival,” which is a compliment in the Troma-verse.



Nice touch naming the crusading reporter Melvin (Shaun Dooley)—a blood-splattered wink to the OG mop-wielder himself. And Taylour Paige as J.J., Toxie’s ride-or-die, holds her own with a mix of badassery and the facial expressions of someone who’s just seen a spleen used as a yo-yo. How about that son, Wade (Jacob Tremblay), busting out some moves on the dance floor? Leads me to my next point.



The humor? Alive. Mutated. Proudly infectious. The girls’ dance troupe shaking it to an aggressively inappropriate song had me choking on nostalgia. Speaking of, if the music budget really landed on “Hall of the Mountain King” instead of “Gutter Ballet,” shortly after, in the street. That is Troma logic, baby. Or a joke I am not getting. I salute the chaos.



Now, the gore. Oh, the gore. Heads get pop-quizzed off with a mop. Limbs fly like bargain-bin confetti. Practical effects hold hands with CGI the way drunks slow-dance at weddings—awkward, sloppy, and perfect. It still feels like a B-movie dipped in beer money and glitter vomit, exactly where it belongs.



Blair doesn’t sand off the edges—he sharpens them. This isn’t some sanitized “modern reimagining.” There are still tits, cameos, filth, goop, indignity, and heart—because even under ten layers of melted skin, The Toxic Avenger is still just a guy trying to save his kid and be the world’s scariest father-in-law.



Is it better than the original? No. But it’s not trying to be. It’s leaning into the glorious stupidity, raunchy enthusiasm, and gleeful carnage that made Troma what it is. Unlike the neutered Hellraiser reboot crimes we recently had to relive, this one embraces the cheesy, sleazy, bloody mayhem and dares us not to grin.



Also: Lloyd Kaufman cameo? Check. Post-credit joke about a billion-dollar box office to finance a sequel? Beautiful. Gratuitous nudity because “this is Troma”? You bet your irradiated butt.



What else can I say? It made the 12-year-old VHS warrior in me scream, “I TOLD YOU SO,” and the adult me kind of wants a glowing mop. Now with 30% More Mop-Based Dismemberment!');

The source material for this production, originally written at the time of the Vietnam War, was an allegory about the draft and its impact on young American men at the time, a mandate that often led to their deaths in an unpopular and largely unexplained conflict. And it’s a statement that’s admittedly still valid (albeit perhaps not as relevant) all these many years later. However, the story’s translation from book to screen in the present day leaves much to be desired, in part because its message isn’t as timely as when the book was written and in part because of the film’s stunningly poor execution. “The Long Walk” tells the tale of a feebly justified (and even more poorly explained) grim ritual in which 50 young men selected from a nationwide lottery embark on a nonstop march in which they must maintain a minimum 3 mph walking speed. Their determined efforts in this symbolic venture are supposedly intended to inspire the population to become more productive citizens in a dystopian version of America as it recovers from a great war. But those who fail to sustain their pace are mercilessly gunned down after three warnings (and who said cold-blooded killing isn’t motivational?). The last man standing in this open-ended competition is named the “winner,” an accomplishment that entitles him to whatever he wishes as a reward. Symbolism and literary surrealism aside, however, the premise behind this work is utterly absurd, especially since participation in the march is voluntary, a betrayal of one of the principal thematic elements of the source material in allegorically criticizing an underlying inhumane mandate. Given that, then, who in their right mind would sign up for something like this? But, beyond the inherent lunacy of its premise (not to mention its contradictory and countless logically implausible plot elements), the picture fails as a well-crafted, engaging work of cinema. To begin with, it commits the cardinal moviemaking sin of predictability, its narrative events and ultimate outcome largely visible from miles away. Next, its storyline quickly becomes tediously repetitive with only minor deviations in plot devices along the way. Its billing as a horror flick is seriously misplaced, as it’s not particularly scary – just gratuitously gross whose shock value impact and multiple disgusting references to bodily functions fade rapidly by going to the same tiresome well far too many times. And, on top of all that, it’s often terribly boring, loaded with protracted conversations among bland, monodimensional characters that just aren’t especially compelling or profound. The screenplay driving all this appears to draw its inspiration from the narratives in pictures like “Platoon” (1986) and any number of classic World War II buddy films but with less articulate and attention-holding writing. To its credit, the film valiantly attempts to infuse the story with insights related to contemporary social and political issues, though these efforts sadly remain largely underdeveloped. What’s more, there are missed opportunities here, too, such as the picture’s failure to make a definitive statement about the bloodsport nature of the event given its popularity with a rapt, admiring and inexplicably reverential public that’s able to watch the entire spectacle via a live video feed. When all of these elements (or should I say shortcomings?) are combined, you’ve got one ridiculously hot cinematic mess (handily one of the worst releases of 2025), one that probably would have been more aptly titled “Roadkill.” I find it puzzling that this offering from the director of four of the five “Hunger Games” franchise releases was unable to work his magic once again in this release in light of the similar nature of this project. However, in my view, this production misses the mark by such a wide margin that, if the sharp-shooters in this story had an aim comparable to that of the director, no one would have died by the time the closing credits roll. But, then, maybe we would have been better off with a picture that produced such an outcome, given that there’s little redeeming entertainment, enlightenment or educational value in this cinematic debacle. And, no matter what anyone might say, in the end, the Emperor is still naked.');

As you can probably tell, this isn''t a "good movie 10/10" type review and I honestly don''t know how to write a good one without spoiling things.

I believe these spoilers are necessary to understand just how disappointing the film is and that they don''t deter from the movie''s "experience". You can already guess that half of the characters will die after the first night and that the main character and his best friend will be the last two remaining.



Also, art is subjective. The review below is my opinion. I''m not claiming that it''s the objective truth.



With that said, let''s get started.



Watching The Long Walk felt precisely as the name suggests: it was a long, tedious, bland and repetitive experience.

It''s the worst kind of bad: It wasn''t a movie about an alien spaceship suddenly interrupting the participants and abducting The Major. This would''ve been a "worse" movie, but at least an entertaining *experience*.

Instead, The Long Walk feels mundane, relentlessly trying to achieve a tone of philosophical seriousness and spectacularly, being something more than "just" a movie (specifically a "great" movie, see below), failing to achieve it.







I''ve structured this review into the four categories I believe make up a "good movie": graphics, story, characters (including dialogue) and worldbuilding.

I am specifically not addressing what makes a movie "great". A great movie, on top of these four categories, has to educate and elevate. Both of these criteria are not just my opinion, a lot of critics and people working in the scene believe that, too, although they may use different terminology. Feel free to disagree, and let me know if you have a better definition of a "good" versus a "great" movie.





The graphics were ... okay. As you likely know, the film is live-action (if you’re reading this review, you probably do) and I noticed that the movie uses an anamorphic lens (simple explanation: makes blurry details look oval), which is usually a sign of high-budget filming and professionalism. The colors were pleasant, I didn''t find them to be too vivid or too dark. The resolution was also okay, I don''t know what the actual resolution was but it didn''t *feel* high-res, especially in facial details. However, I only noticed it when I was specifically looking for it, so I''ll give the (percieved) resolution a pass.

What I did find problematic was the frame rate. The movie had some fast-moving shots close to corn fields in a low frame rate, which made me nauseous, and I normally *never* get anything close to nauseous when watching all kinds of movies.





A simple story isn''t inherently bad. A movie can excel with a simple story, provided the characters are interesting and well-developed and the worldbuilding is there.

But I''m not sure how to describe the story of The Long Walk, as there hardly is one. The overarching plot is exactly what the overview suggests: 50 people walking for their lives. What you read is what you get, there''s nothing extra, nothing special.

There are some interesting characters that briefly spice up the story, including our main character Raymond Garraty and his new best friend, Peter McVries, who he meets during the walk. I''ll talk more about them in the next part.

What was interesting to see, or rather what would''ve been interesting to see if it didn''t fail with the characters and worldbuilding, was Ray''s arrival to The Long Walk with his mother and his later reunion with her during the walk. The former was also one of the few instances of worldbuilding in the movie, which I’ll address later.

What also really confused me was the timing of the warnings. While some characters got theirs after just seconds of standing still, others could stop for minutes before anything would happen. It took away all immersion (if there was any left, we''ll get to that) because it truly felt like the timings were set up to make the movie more dramatic.





Talking about the characters is hard, because 75% die after the first day. I will ignore them, because most of them don''t contribute anything to the plot. The first day also seemingly only consists of trash talk, which I''m also going to ignore for the most part.



The characters in The Long Walk represent a profound missed opportunity. A lot of interesting philosophical and ethical topics are introduced, only for the characters to abruptly abandon them after just a few minutes.



I''d like to start by talking about the - in my opinion - best-characterized character, Gary Barkovitch.

He provokes another walker, Rank, into attacking him, leading to Rank’s execution. Not only the characters, but also you as viewer despise him for that. We only later find out that this wasn''t actually his intention (?) and he is truly sorry for "murdering" Rank. He tries to get back on good terms with the group and shortly after kills himself.

It''s one of the only two instances of character development I could find in the movie. The movie hints at Barkovitch''s past, and it’s a shame it doesn’t explore the character more deeply, as the novel does.

Barkovitch''s character is thin and his development lacking, but it’s the best the movie offered, and I want to acknowledge that.



Next, there’s Richard Harkness, the "nerd" of the group, and an opposite to Barkovitch. He knows everything about The Long Walk and is participating in hopes of writing a book about it and selling it for profit.

What his seemingly large intellect fails to let him realize is that his character''s intention don''t make any sense. If he doesn''t win the walk, he''ll die and won''t be able to publish his book; if he does, he''ll have enough money to not need the book anymore. He''s portrayed as a smart character, it makes no sense for him to not have realized this.

Furthermore, when he actually *does* die (because - who would''ve thought - the main character and his best friend are the last remaining two) his dialogue attempts to hint at some degree of character development ("I finally understood what The Long Walk is actually about," if my memory is correct), which was never shown. His personality remained that of a stereotypical obnoxious nerd throughout the film, until his demise.



Finally, it’s time to analyze our main character. He''ll be the last one I''ll talk about, I can''t do that anymore.

Ray Garraty''s wish, if he''ll win The Long Walk, is a gun, as he plans to shoot The Major, who killed his dad for spreading "wrong thoughts and ideas".

McVries has to tell him his whole (okay-ish, very generic) backstory, to convince him that love is more important than vengeance. Don''t confuse that with character development - Garraty doesn''t actually seem to change his stance on the topic. In fact, I''d even call it reverse character development, as it is McVries who wins the race, asks for a gun and shoots The Major. At least it''s ... something.

Ray''s character is one of the only interesting and nuanced ones, as (two) snippets of his backstory are actually shown in the movie. (Yes, only two.) His bond to his mother is one of the few instances I could actually relate to a character. In fact, he actually sees his mother near the end of The Long Walk again, nearly getting all his three warnings, activating his plot armor with some help from McVries and continuing walking right before he''s going to be shot. We never see his mother again.





I want to keep the worldbuilding part short. Firstly, because there - who would''ve guessed - barely is any and because I''ve already wasted enough time with this review.

Firstly, I want to give credit to the start of the movie where there actually was worldbuilding: We could hear some propaganda coming from the radio, hinting at the political situation of the country, and we could see Ray and his mother talking about The Great Walk in the car.

After that, there are only three instances of worldbuilding:



> Ray''s dream about his mom



> The assassination of Ray''s father, with the dream scene copy-pasted in front of it.



> Peter McVries telling Ray about his background and his life until now (it''s not even visualized on screen, they''re literally just talking).



 

Except for these, the only thing we ever see is the street where the walk is being held.

We do not get any other information about the world the movie plays in.

And that''s a shame.





Mystery is a valuable thing. But it needs a foundation - a world where these mysteries can live. The Long Walk failed to build that world - and that''s my main gripe with it.



No, we never learn why The Long Walk got held (beyond the vague reasoning of "to make the population more productive").



No, we never learn what led the world into its current state.



No, we never learn what The Great War was.



No, we never learn how the people who watched the walk live on TV even reacted to it.



No, we never learn what happened to Collie Parker''s wife.



No, we never learn what happened to Ray''s mother.



And no, we never lean what happens after The Major got assassinated.







I can''t, in good conscience, recommend this movie to anyone.

Another review suggested renaming it to "Roadkill" and I wholeheartedly agree. This movie is about people being graphically killed for reasons unknown to the viewer, while you wait for something of value to occur. If that doesn''t sound interesting to you - please don''t watch the movie.

I seriously want my money back, not because of its value to me, but because I don''t think Lionsgate deserves it.



If you''re actually interested in the story the movie tried to tell and the lesson we can learn from it, go read the novel. I read a lot of quotes from the novel while researching for this review, and it truly seems like the story I expected from the movie. Seriously, go read that instead.');

This is story is, in essence, a condensed metaphor, for walking the passage of life, its hopes, its dreams, nightmares and what life truly means to each of us, when its about to end. This is, in its own way, also a harsh repudiation of state sanctioned violence. Where the young are brutally sacrificed, by the old, in the pursuit of power and control.



In spite of the fact this film is derived from Stephen Kings work, an author I have mixed feelings about, Id characterize it as an "instant classic". Thirty years from now this will be as refresh, remarkable, moving and memorable as it was in 2025. 



Why? Putting aside the more than excellent, intelligently written script, what makes this essentially very simple film shine is polished, quality acting. A rare thing these days, where candy coated CGI and "doing stuff" has taken the place of thoughtful, insightful cinema. The acting from the whole cast is  credit worthy but the leads Cooper Hoffman and David Jonsson, offer up performances that are stark, honestly human, in short, exceptional.

It appears they have each won a lottery and a prize of untold riches awaits the winner of a walking competition. The rules are simple. Keep above 3 m.p.h. and don’t stop. “Ray” (Cooper Hoffman) pays an emotion farewell to his mum and joins a group of lads that includes “Pete” (David Jonsson); the somewhat odious “Barkovitch” (Charlie Plummer), talkative “Olson” (Ben Wang) and the lithe and fit looking “Stebbins” (Garrett Wareing) and “Art” (Tut Nyuot). A rousing speech from the “Major” (Mark Hamill) explains the rules to them, and makes clear that it will quite literally be the last man standing who wins. Quickly, “Ray” and “Pete” bond and as they set off, we discover more about what makes these two men tick, interspersed with some lively contributions from their fellow walkers who manage to engage, irritate, offend and motivate as the miles accrue and the numbers dwindle. This takes a fairly intense look at the processes of male bonding and both Hoffman and Jonsson deliver powerfully compelling performances as both characters come to terms with an unpleasant inevitability as hunger and sleep deprivation take their toll. Both Wang and Plummer also deliver unexpectedly charismatic efforts here: a far cry from anything I’ve seen either do before, and though he’s not on screen often, Hamill also manages to exude a degree of malevolent megalomania as this effort to reenergise the not so industrious youth of America travels the country. I felt that it built well to a poignant denouement, but at the moment of truth it rather lost it’s potency and I think it caved in a bit. Still, there is an intensity, a warmth and some vulnerability on show here as both physical and mental endurance are tested to the limits whilst wrapped in a coat of guilt, ambition and increasing inter-reliance. It’s not an easy watch, but as a (less brutal) allegory for so much of modern day, dog-eat-dog life, it works really quite powerfully.');

The superhero film feels like a sci-fi film from the 1960s, which makes sense since Fantastic Four #1 debuted in 1961. Maybe it’s the bright colors or the fact that H.E.R.B.I.E. is featured so prominently, but the first half of the film feels like a multi-episode arc of The Jetsons.



Things are lighthearted and fairly silly until The Silver Surfer shows up. But The Fantastic Four and James Gunn’s Superman seem to be honoring the silver age of comic books, which is a welcome change for superhero films.  



Oddly, the marketing makes it seem like the family bond amongst The Fantastic Four is so strong because it doesn’t seem that great while watching it. The film isn’t an origin story, as you only get a brief montage of how they got their powers. But there’s a lot of indecisiveness amongst the team with Franklin on the way. The way time passes in the film is weird. Sue’s pregnancy and Franklin’s age (apart from a certain time jump) seem accelerated, and it’s difficult to decipher if that much time has passed (nine months for the pregnancy, plus however many additional months Franklin is supposed to be) or if it’s fast-tracked because they all have powers.



The casting in The Fantastic Four: First Steps is fine, but they still seem to be finding a rhythm as a team. Reed’s brain works in a way that has him thinking of the worst scenarios, while his plans and logic stem from building everything around the most horrible solution. Sue just wants her baby to thrive in the presence of a loving family. She doesn’t want to give him to Galactus or decide his fate if he happens to have powers. She wants him to live and flourish with his own identity and choices.



The film seems to hint at Johnny being a womanizer, but he’s painfully single here. He latches onto The Silver Surfer and devotes a good chunk of the film to learning her language just so he can talk to her. The fate of the world may be at stake, sure, but dat silver ass has light years to travel and he’s got to make his moves now.



Ben is kinda boring, honestly. He shows interest in Rachel Rozman (Natasha Lyonne) and returning to the places that remind him of what it’s like to feel normal, but unless he’s destroying something or lifting a car over his head, he’s a little forgettable. He isn’t conflicted enough and doesn’t clobber enough things to leave a lasting impression.



Reed and Sue have noticeable chemistry, and they should given that they’re married. And Johnny and Ben have this macho kind of bro energy where they’re always ribbing each other and yet also sarcastically supporting one another (Ben’s beard, Johnny referring to himself in third person). As a foursome and a team, though, they still seem to be lacking, like they’re still learning to coordinate cohesively instead of Reed or Sue calling it on the spot.



The film takes place four years after the cosmic storm that caused them to gain their powers. But maybe the “first steps” part of the title refers to them still learning to work together as a team, as well as Franklin’s first baby steps.



The visual effects are mostly extremely impressive, with a few noticeable green screen shots and face animations being the only funky inclusions. The Silver Surfer’s face looks awkward at times, like it isn’t properly centered on Julia Garner’s body, or something. I wasn’t a huge fan of how the Human Torch looked either. His body is just orange with some lazy flames at the sides that don’t even cover his entire body.



The Silver Surfer chase sequences in the wormhole are some of the best the MCU has ever done. There was a bit of an uproar amongst the internet community when The Silver Surfer turned out to be female in this, but the character is given the coolest moments in the film and arguably the film’s most emotional sequence apart from the film’s finale. It''s been apparent since Doctor Strange has been hinting at it in both of his films, but the MCU needs to go fully cosmic for its next phase.



Despite being beloved around the world and being a team for a decent amount of time, it feels like The Fantastic Four are still working out the kinks of being a solid team in First Steps. The performances are solid, the chemistry amongst the cast is great, and there are sentimental moments sprinkled throughout the entire film. 



There’s a lot of promise in what the future of the MCU holds with this version of The Fantastic Four, and it’s somewhat of a relief to have a Fantastic Four film that is actually worthwhile and hopefully worth revisiting with fondness instead of regret.');

The strong performances from the cast boost the film’s overall credibility, and the special effects are (admittedly) top notch. The themes lean heavily on the idea that family is not only biological, but also can be chosen, and there’s a nice balance between the need to be superheroes as well as parents and a strongly bonded family.

He deftly develops atmosphere whilst simultaneously ensuring we the viewers are very much a part of the setting and situations - something Lehane does so brilliantly in his novels.

The demon-hunting trinity is led by Ba Woo (Ma Dong-Seok), a beast of a man capable of solving most of his problems with his bulking fists. Whatever slips through Ba Woo’s fingers is typically dealt with by Sharon (Seohyun), a woman who can sense and exorcise demons. Then there’s Kim Goon (Lee David), a demon hunter in training who is the team''s tech support.



A neuropsychiatrist named Jung-won (Kyung Soo-jin) is trying to help her sister Eun-seo (Jung Ji-so) who is in desperate need of an exorcism. With the church unable to assist with their stance on exorcisms it’s up to Ba Woo and his team to save Eun-seo.



It feels like Holy Night: Demon Hunters is the second installment of a franchise that nobody knew about. A prequel webtoon called Holy Night: The Zero is available on Naver Webtoon and is currently 13 episodes long. The webtoon could add more depth to the film since Holy Night: Demon Hunters seems to struggle to keep your interest for its measly 92-minute duration. Like Richard Kelly’s Southland Tales though, viewers shouldn’t have to read or watch something else to fully appreciate a director’s vision.



The action horror film teases a real-world takeover by not only demons but Lucifer himself. The credits introduce the audience to every demon that could come into play. Holy Night: Demon Hunters barely scratches the surface of the ideas it introduces so it’s a bit confusing why so many aspects are shown and not utilized. The film then decides to vaguely describe semi-intriguing backgrounds for characters barely seen through to completion.



Ba Woo is using all the money he’s making as a demon hunter to build an orphanage. He grew up as an orphan where the orphanage he grew up was slaughtered by his best friend whom he viewed as a brother. The two of them gained a demonic power, and Ba Woo used his power for good while his brother became a demon.



The majority of the rest of the film is devoted to Eun-Seo, her exorcism, and which demon has possessed her. The exorcism Sharon uses on her is broken down into six stages (and a piece of bamboo since it thwarts off demonic energy for whatever reason). The six stages of exorcism are presence, deception, break point, voice, clash, and expulsion.



Most of the characters in the film are underdeveloped. Ba Woo is a big, buffed dude struggling with both literal and inner demons inside of him. Sharon is in the same boat and her power could easily sway her to the dark side. Apart from asking for a raise and being the most sympathetic of the bunch, Kim Goon doesn’t do much.



Jung-won is so annoyingly written. The character is meant to be a burden by being in the room during the exorcism for no reason other than being an obstacle, making stupid decisions at every turn, and being an inconsolable crier at every turn.



The VFX in the film is a mixed bag. Sometimes they look almost great like when Ba Woo punches demon-possessed people as smoke seeps from their bodies or the weird shadow demon that haunts him throughout the film. But the CGI highs come with a lot of visual lows and Holy Night: Demon Hunters struggles with decent to janky CGI the majority of the time.



Holy Night: Demon Hunters is a punchier version of Constantine. There are some fun sequences, but the film is a bummer overall. Ma Dong-seok typically chooses great projects to be a part of and it’s unfortunate that Holy Night: Demon Hunters feels so rushed and complete. A big dude storming around the city punching demons into submission sounds so awesome, but somehow Lim Dae-hee turned it into this thin, dull, and lifeless attempt at purification.');

They ran into the street and disappeared into the darkness. They all attend Maybrook Elementary, and all of them were from Justine Gandy’s (Julia Garner) class. The one student who didn’t leave was Alex Lilly (Cary Christopher), who is now quieter and reserved than ever. 



Parents of the missing children, including Archer Graff (Josh Brolin), believe that Justine Gandy either had something to do with it or knows where they are. Things turn hostile, and people begin dying in gruesome ways as this seemingly cursed town scrambles for answers. 



In 2022, writer and director Zach Cregger wowed audiences and critics with Barbarian. Now Cregger returns with Weapons, a film with a bigger budget, bigger stars, and a more intricate story that intertwines horror, drama, and comedy. 



How the children are disappearing can be solved relatively easily while researching the film online, but it’s best to go in blind. Half the charm of Weapons is riding through the mystery as it unravels because it takes some violent and unexpected detours. The film is told through the perspectives of five individuals: Justine, Archer, a cop named Paul (Alden Ehrenreich) who has a complicated relationship with Justine, Alex, and a drug addict named James (Austin Abrams). 



Weapons isn’t as shocking or as scary as Barbarian. There are still moments of extreme gore and several moments that take you off guard, but the creepiest parts of Weapons are nightmares that Justine or Archer has. The unsettling sensation is there, but the fact that you know that these are nightmares and the film chooses not to hide that in the slightest makes its impact less potent. 



Everything in Weapons is tied to Alex’s aunt Gladys (Amy Madigan). Gladys is incredibly sick and comes to stay with Alex and his parents. She wears a bright red wig, puts on entirely too much red lipstick, and wears vibrant, colored clothes. If it wasn’t for her pale, wrinkly, and sickly looking frame, she’d have a clown-like appearance. She appears in the dreams Justine and Archer are having, and there’s a reason for that. 



The film is surprisingly funny. There are several laugh-out-loud moments sprinkled throughout the film, but James is in the film for several important reasons. His motivation is simple for a guy who is constantly tweaking, as he is constantly trying to make money as quickly as he can to get to his next fix. He becomes the comedic catalyst for Paul, and his audible reactions as he’s caught on multiple occasions are amusing. James is the main comic relief of Weapons, but he also stumbles onto the first strong lead of what happened to the missing children. 



Camera placement is interesting in weapons as it’s constantly behind the actors. You notice body language more while staring at someone’s back, and it also makes it feel like you’re either following or chasing them the entire film. There’s also an emphasis on doors. There is a specific door to a specific house in the film that is just as threatening closed as it is open. From the outside looking in, there’s no difference. So the threat of not knowing what’s inside and what’s on the other side of that door is always there. 



Weapons expands upon Zach Cregger’s storytelling and directing capabilities and offers what is arguably the biggest crowd-pleasing finale of any film this year. It’s much more layered and caters to more than just one specific audience, like Barbarian did. There’s gore and tension, humorous interactions, and the character drama in between keeps you interested throughout. 



It’s a well-written and unpredictable story, but it also feels like something is missing. It could be that it isn’t straightforward horror or that its reputation has built it up a bit too much. Weapons is a bonkers mystery that is worth seeing, and Zach Cregger is as bold as ever as a filmmaker, but it simply doesn’t leave you with that same sense of being completely blown away like after viewing Barbarian for the first time.');

The deeply unsettling premise stems from the simultaneous disappearance of nearly all the students in a class (except one) in a single night, without explanation, creating a constant tension in the narrative. Zach Cregger, in his dual role as director and screenwriter, creates a web of parallel narratives that intertwine with precision, proving emotionally powerful and insidious in its construction of mystery.



The cast - especially Julia Garner as teacher Justine, Josh Brolin in a tormented fatherly role, and Amy Madigan as a sinister, mythical figure - infuses the characters with depth and dramatic intensity.



The technical quality is on par with the performances: Larkin Seiple''s cinematography imbues the most disturbing scenes with an almost supernatural light, while the editing pace maintains suspense without resorting to easy solutions. The film doesn''t just scare; it makes us think, reflect, and feel the growing panic in the community it portrays.



Overall, "WEAPONS" stands out as a sophisticated and ambitious thriller that goes far beyond conventional horror. Its approach, anchored in symbolic realism and imbued with metaphorical violence, stands as a social and psychological commentary on the contemporary climate of paranoia, evoking, without explicitly stating, echoes of real school tragedies. The tension builds organically and culminates in a brutal climax, yet consistent with the entire preceding development.

The cops are baffled and the parents are suspicious. Of what? Well, they were all from the same class of “Justine” (Julia Garner) and the only other pupil to turn up next day: “Alex” (Cary Christopher). What has she done with them all? What does she know? We start with a telling of events from her point of view, then next it’s the perspective of angry parent “Archer” (Josh Brolin) to weave his part of the web; then policemen “Paul” (Alden Ehrenreich); her boss “Marcus” (Benedict Wong) and then, finally, we get the perspective of the only “surviving” pupil who has recently welcomed his eccentric aunt “Gladys” (Amy Madigan) who is apparently on death’s door, and who seems somewhat distracted as he comes to school. Is that because his classmates have all gone awol or maybe he knows more than we think? To be honest, there’s not so much mystery here, but there are some solidly entertaining performances and for the first hour or so, quite a bit of intriguing menace too. The overlaying of each story takes us from similar timelines of the puzzle but never repetitively. Each one of these people has a demon of their own, they are connected to some of the others and not to others, and the whole unravelling process becomes more of a study of small time communities, attitudes and superstitions as it sort of shakes off it’s horror cloak and becomes something altogether more rushed and predictable. Garner, Christopher and Madigan deliver quite well, but Brolin is about as charismatic as a tent pole and as he starts to feature more in the denouement he does rather encourage you to hope that he goes the way of the missing kids. It’s very much at the better end of the genre from 2025 so far, but it still can’t sustain the mysterious “Pied Piper” sense of peril through to an ending that is hardly original.');

Regrettably, however, that’s where the latest offering from writer-director Zach Cregger drops the ball, a downfall brought on by a host of other shortcomings. The film chronicles the mysterious overnight disappearance of all but one student from the third grade class of newly hired teacher Justine Gandy (Julia Garner). While there’s no direct evidence implicating her in this troubling event, she quickly becomes a target for scrutiny and ridicule, particularly since null of the other elementary school’s classes reported any missing pupils. Officials are at a loss, and the only one of Ms. Gandy’s students who did not vanish, Alex Lilly (Cary Christopher), is unable to shed any light on why he was spared the same fate as his classmates. As the investigation continues, Justine’s background – most notably her penchant for alcohol abuse and her tendency to become too involved in the lives of her students – comes under closer examination by the police, the school principal (Benedict Wong) and the father of one of the disappeared children (Josh Brolin). The story is told in a nonlinear fashion with chapters based on the experiences of the film’s primary characters, with each segment gradually (one might more realistically say tediously) revealing different pieces of an enigmatic puzzle as seen from their respective perspectives. Admittedly, this is an interesting and commendable approach for telling the tale, one not typically employed in horror films. However, that narrative is also part of the problem, given that it’s slowly paced and sparsely frightful. It’s also seriously lacking a much-needed revelatory back story, leaving viewers wondering why events are unfolding as they do (and, consequently, leaving them unsure why they should care, either). As the picture plays out, it also loses focus, uncertain whether it wants to be a sinister thriller or a sidesplitting campy romp (I’ll vote for the latter option here, as that seems to be when the picture works best, especially with the arrival of Alex’s mysterious Aunt Gladys (Amy Madigan), who bears an uncanny and inexplicable resemblance to Bozo the Clown). All things considered, though, these elements don’t hang together well, and, as the film drones on and on, it’s easy to lose interest, especially since the rationale behind them is largely unclear. What’s more, several passing plot devices of a questionably stereotypical nature have been incorporated here as well, leaving one to ponder the reason for their inclusion. “Weapons,” unfortunately, is yet another example of a supposedly scary movie gone wrong, one that fails at its basic task and doesn’t deliver the goods on so many other fronts. Maybe the time has come for Hollywood to give this genre a rest for a while so that it can work out its growing list of issues before production begins on a round of more underwhelming, overhyped releases like this one.');

This statement is worthy of investigation for several reasons.



Fellowship is indeed merely an opening salvo, and even after three hours in the dark you will likely exit the cinema ravenous with anticipation for the further two parts of the trilogy. Fellowship is also unabashedly rooted in the fantasy genre. Not to be confused with the techno-cool of good science fiction, nor even the cutesy charm of family fare like Harry Potter, the territory of Tolkien is clearly marked by goo and goblins and gobbledegook. Persons with an aversion to lines such as, “To the bridge of Khazad-dûm!” are as well to stay within the Shire-like comforts of home (their loss).



With those caveats in place, it bears repeating: fantasy does not come finer. There are electrifying moments — notably the computer-assisted swooping camera through Isengard as it transforms into a factory for evil — when Jackson’s flight of fancy approaches the sublime as the romantic poets would understand it: inspiring awe.



Leaving aside the thorny issue of Tolkien die-hards and their inevitable gripes — “What no Tom Bombadil?” — Jackson’s screenplay (written in collaboration with Fran Walsh and Phillipa Boyens) is both bolder and more judicious than Steven Kloves’ surprisingly timid retread of Harry Potter. In particular, rescuing the romance of Arwen and Aragorn from the footnotes and the elevation of Saruman to all-action bad guy actually has a corrective influence on Tolkien’s often oblique and female-sparse source material.



There are problems, though. The three-hour running time is high on incident and low on discernible form. After successive detours to Elf habitats Rivendell (the watery home of Elrond) and Lothlórien (the forest home of the Lady Galadriel), the uninitiated might well ask why these crazy Elf kids can’t just live together and spare us all this attenuated dramatic structure.



More importantly, the action clearly climaxes in the desperate flight from the Mines Of Moria, where the largely seamless SFX is showcased in the best possible light — total darkness — but the narrative demands a different, downbeat ending. Indeed, but for some fine emotional playing from Bean, Mortensen, Astin and Wood, the final fight might feel like a particularly brutal game of paintball in Bluebell Wood. But then, the real battles are yet to come...





Verdict - Putting formula blockbusters to shame, Fellowship is impeccably cast and constructed with both care and passion: this is a labour of love that never feels laboured. Emotional range and character depth ultimately take us beyond genre limitations, and it deserves to play as wide as a certain Mr. Potter.

RELEASED 2001 and directed by Peter Jackson, “The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring” adapts the first part of JRR Tolkien’s popular fantasy trilogy about adventures on Middle-Earth. The story starts in the homeland of the Hobbits (innocent, diminutive humanoids) where Frodo (Elijah Wood) is instructed by the noble wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellen) to quickly leave the Shire with the powerful One Ring in his possession. Gandalf and Frodo are later accompanied by seven others, the titular ‘Fellowship of the Ring,’ to take the ring to the only place it can be destroyed, the fires of Mount Doom in Mordor. 



The rest of the main cast include Sean Astin (Sam), Viggo Mortensen (Aragorn), Sean Bean (Boromir), Christopher Lee (Saruman), Orlando Bloom (Legolas), John Rhys-Davies (Gimli) and Hugo Weaving (Elrond).        



This three-hour fantasy features a diverse cast of colorful characters, quaint beings and settings, moments of genuine wonder, dark ee-vil creatures, high adventure, thrilling brutal action, a superb score, magnificent locations (forests, mountains, rivers, etc.), and wondrous CGI sets. The film LOOKS and SOUNDS so great that it’d be sinful to give it a lower rating. 



There are problems, however, at least for those who aren’t uber-fans of Tolkien. For one, the opening is hindered by prologue that is overlong and convoluted, not to mention unnecessary. The bulk of it could’ve been conveyed later via flashback, which they do a little bit anyway. Secondly, the story takes forever to build any drive. Thirdly, except for maybe Frodo and Gandalf, the characters are shallow and I didn’t care much what happened to them. Fourthly, main protagonists getting seriously wounded and everyone else expressing their melodramatic concern gets redundant.  



Fifthly, there are only two females in the main cast (Liv Tyler as Arwen, a half-Elf princess, and Cate Blanchett as Galadriel, a royal Elf); unfortunately, their parts aren’t much more than glorified cameos. “Mythica: A Quest for Heroes” (2014) cost LESS THAN $100,000 to make, which is a mere fraction of the $93 million it cost to make this blockbuster and the filmmakers knew enough to include a couple of prominent babes as key protagonists in the story. 



Despite these negatives, “The Fellowship of the Ring” is the best of the trilogy and is a must for fantasy/adventure aficionados, especially Tolkien fans.

The casting, to start, was brilliant.  Sean Astin was the absolute perfect choice for Sam, and did a remarkable job bringing that character to life for us.  He really WAS Sam, in this role, in a very deep way.  I always liked his acting, but here, he showed how talented he actually is.  Just amazing.  Elijah Wood gives a great performance of Frodo, and those expressive eyes of his really add a lot of depth to the emotions the character goes through, which are such an important part of the story.  Billy Boyd and Dominic Monaghan both did great work, for our other two main hobbits.  Their smiles, their singing; just every aspect of these characters was so real.  Viggo Mortensen, of course, was excellent.  He''s always good, and though I never would have pictures him as Aragorn, he delivered everything we could hope for.  Great choice for that role!  John Rhys-Davies, as expected, gave us the Gimli we wanted.  Phenomenal actor, and I can''t imagine anyone doing that role better.  Orlando Bloom plays a convincing Legolas, and handles the nuances of being an elf quite well.  Sean Bean as Boromir was outstanding, bringing the strength of that character to life, and making us love him.  Then we have Ian McKellen, as Gandalf.  I could never have chosen someone for that role, but the casting folks hit a home run with this one.  Everything about his character was just right.  Literally everything.  I can''t read the books without seeing these people in these roles now.  The rest of the cast ws good as well.



Then we have the setting.  New Zealand has to have some of the most utterly gorgeous scenery on the planet.  Seeing it in these movies was great, and convincingly Middle Earth, and seeing more since, in other videos, just WOW!  Thanks, to the people of New Zealand, for allowing this to be filmed there!  



The sets were just fantastic.  Everything looked as good as I''d always hoped it would look, with all the charm, mystery, and wonder  Tolkien fan could hope for.  From Bag end to Rivendell to the vastness of 

Middle Earth, everything we saw was just right.  



The only issues I had were some of the changes.  Yes, I know things don''t always work in movies as they do in books, but when whole sections are just omitted, that bothers me.  It''s not like the movies weren''t long already!  That omitted section, with which Tolkien fans will be quite familiar, was a very important part of the plot!  I also didn''t care for some of the other changes, and the way Arwen was used, the scene at the river being one example.  



All in all, though, this was a well done movie, and even though some things bug me, this film, and the rest of the series, will be viewed many times.  Classics, worth collecting and treasuring.');

Don’t get me wrong, I like this movie and have watched it a few times over the years, but I have watched  (or read, for that matter) very little else in the fantasy  genre. I didn’t get too far into the Game of Thrones as the violent rapes got old for me fast. 



So I watched this first entry of the Lord of the Rings trilogy as just a viewer, not a fan, and I liked it just fine. The complex plot held together well and the scenery was gorgeous. There was violence, but not gore, and for those who don’t like war movies, there wasn’t as much of it here as there is in the other two films of the trilogy.



I gather the elfin roles for women were enlarged and brought to the fore, and why not; women were mostly good for setting mead and large pieces of rare meat down on tables in front of their warrior men.



I must confess, I found it jarring that the warriors like Strider were so invincible, walking into a horde of sixty orcs and scattering them like toy soldiers with his sword. I know they are epic heroes, but if I’m an orc, I stand back and throw something or whatever, but it is similar to the old legends with semi-gods like Achilles, back when Hector was a pup.



I am not going to compare the film to the book — I read it decades ago when I was in high school. It is worth watching and though real fans will take this with a large grain of salt, I think it is possibly the definitive adaptation of the book. (I need to watch the other two entries in the series before I say the same about those.) if you are among the 12% percent of movie goers who haven’t seen it, give it a try.');

<em>''The Lord of the Rings''</em> is yet another film series that I am incredibly late to viewing, at least I''ve finally got around to it... albeit almost twenty years on from this film''s release.



<em>''The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring''</em> is delightful. I never know what to expect from a film that goes on for nearly three hours, the pacing has to be near perfection for it to work - and boy does it here. The run time flew by, which is always a terrific sign.



I love a load of things about this, the one that actually sticks out most is the outstanding score. Music can play a huge part in how much I enjoy a film, so I''m delighted to say that the score is here is fantastic. That is by no means the only positive, obviously.



The cast are excellent. Elijah Wood gives a strong performance in the lead role. I''ve seen Wood in others things down the years and have actually found him a bit hit-and-miss, but here he is very good. Elsewhere, I really enjoyed watching Viggo Mortensen''s character.



Away from those two, there are a whole host of noteworthy cast members. Orlando Bloom, or Will Turner to me, is involved, as are the likes of Ian McKellen and Sean Bean. I also liked Liv Tyler in her role.



The look of the film is spectacular, and has aged extremely well even to this day. Everything from the cinematography to the costumes is brilliant, those two things really make the film come alive - helped by the aforementioned score, of course.

Based on the fantasy world written by Tolkien, we see the halfling hobbits, the most unlikely of heroes, a breed of human type beings who indulge in pleasures, games, and fun, and do little evil.

In the same world are more powerful beings, some good, like the elves and wizards, some evil, like the orcs, trolls, and dragons, and some in between, like the dwarves and men.

And one evil super being, Sauron, the second in command to the "devil" of this world called Middle Earth, and that devil called Melkor is now in chains and powerless, so Sauron rules all evil.

That said, we get a very faithful version to the book, only improved. This is the first of three segments called "The Lord of the Rings". The parts left out are parts best left out. Tom Bombadil, for example, along with his wife, represents a very Hitler like Aryan ideology of supremacy that Tolkien often engaged in. 

The film begins with a narrative and action sequence that is awesome, and then goes into the "status quo" setting of the "shire" of hobbits, much like the status quo setting of films like "Women of Dolwyn".

From there, we get an amazing story of four hobbits who embark on a journey of utmost importance, joined by a wizard, an elf, a dwarf, and two men.

The direction is stunning. The motivation even better explained than in the Tolkien books. This is a masterpiece.');

You can only wonder at the sheer imagination of JRR Tolkien and of Peter Jackson, Fran Walsh & Philippa Boyens as they adeptly adapt this epic tale of power for a new generation. Certainly, it over-hams the accents - maybe just a few too many "rrrs" in "Arrragorrrrn" but otherwise it''s a feast for senses. When the hairy-footed Hobbit "Bilbo" (Sir Ian Holm) gets to eleventy-one he sets off to write his life-story with the elves. He leaves his possessions - including a mysterious ring - to Frodo (Elijah Wood). When visiting wizard "Gandalf" (Sir Ian McKellen) identifies it as the epitome of wickedness that puts all of their lives are in danger, "Frodo" and his lifelong friend "Sam" (Sean Astin) must flee their bucolic happiness. This first instalment of the trilogy tracks the journey of the hobbits as they meet "Stryder" (Viggo Mortensen) and together try to evade the pursuing wraith attempting to get to "Elrond" the Elvish king in "Rivendell" and decide what is best to do with this evil, seemingly indestructible talisman. Their only solution proves to be returning the ring to the lava-filled cavern of "Mount Doom" where it was forged: only there can it''s corruption be defeated. The brave hobbits, together with two men, an elf and a dwarf set out to accomplish this all but impossible task fighting the weather, evil orcs, malevolent magic and the harsh terrain on their treacherous way. It''s the ultimate fantasy adventure; that sticks to the spirit, if not to every word, of the original work. The effects both in make-up and from the computer are expertly applied creating a real sense of tension and peril that compliments, rather than subsumes, the actual action and beautiful cinematography of the New Zealand scenery through which our intrepid gang must travel. This is probably the weakest of the three episodes as it takes a good hour to get going; but once it does and the "Fellowship" takes firmer form with a superb John Howard-Davies; a handsome Orlando Bloom and even the usually wooden Sean Bean raises his game to give us as a truly cracking, at times quite scary adventure that is magnificently scored by the inspired Howard Shore. This is not really a film that works on the telly - however large the screen may be. To do justice to the creativity of all concerned it just has to be given the respect it deserves and be seen in the cinema. If you get a chance, you should go see it (again!).');

Peter Jackson’s The Fellowship of the Ring, the start of this epic journey, remains unmatched in its reverence for Tolkien’s work – not merely as an epic tale, but as a moral and mythological construct with its own internal gravity. Unlike many contemporary fantasy productions, which often treat Tolkien’s world as a loose template to be re-skinned, Jackson’s film operates as a careful translation, not a reinvention. Every creative decision, from script to score to set design, reflects an understanding that Middle-earth is not a playground, but a legendarium – a world with its own laws, languages, and deeply rooted cosmology. It is this sense of literary responsibility that makes Fellowship not just a good adaptation, but a great one.



Too many modern shows, even those cloaked in Tolkien’s vocabulary, feel less like adaptations and more like speculative reinterpretations – injecting modern anxieties and tropes into a narrative that was already rich in timeless concerns. Where those newer productions often flatten the moral contours of the story into grey ambiguity or impulsive spectacle, Jackson’s Fellowship preserves the text’s theological seriousness and philosophical clarity. It understands, crucially, that Tolkien was not writing about swords and sorcery, but about humility, sacrifice, and the perilous allure of domination. The Ring is not a mere object of power – it is a spiritual test – and the film never lets us forget it.



The performances reflect this deeper understanding. Ian McKellen’s Gandalf is not a stock wizard, but a being of deep time, burdened by knowledge and reluctant authority. Elijah Wood’s Frodo captures the very soul of Tolkien’s hobbit – a creature of small stature and immense will, shouldering a task no one would envy. Sean Astin’s Samwise is played not for comic relief, but as a paragon of unsung virtue: loyalty without ambition, courage without ego. Viggo Mortensen’s Aragorn is a man wrestling with history, shaped by the burden of lineage, not the thrill of it. These portrayals are not just emotionally effective; they are textually faithful.



Cate Blanchett’s Galadriel deserves special mention. Her portrayal embodies the strange, luminous power of the Elves as Tolkien wrote them – otherworldly and terrible in equal measure. Her temptation scene is delivered with haunting restraint, the grandeur of her voice a vessel for ancient sorrow and quiet wisdom. This Galadriel is not a warrior queen in the modern sense, but a bearer of deep time, whose greatness lies in her refusal to grasp at power. It is a performance that understands the Elvish condition: to be fading, beautiful, and bound to a world no longer theirs. Blanchett’s screen time is brief, but the echo of her presence lingers – like Elven light in dark places.



Jackson’s adaptation respects Tolkien’s languages and mythic structures with near-obsessive care. Elvish is not set dressing; it is spoken with phonetic integrity, tied to cultures that feel ancient and real. The geography, costumes, architecture – each bears the mark of deep lore, not just visual flair. Howard Shore’s score, informed by the same gravitas, does not accompany the film so much as inhabit it. His themes are not just musical motifs but narrative threads, echoing the rise and fall of kingdoms and the quiet dignity of small acts of heroism.

What distinguishes The Fellowship of the Ring is that it treats Tolkien’s world as something already complete – something to be entered humbly, not reshaped. In doing so, it achieves a rare artistic feat: it becomes an extension of the text, not a commentary on it. While newer works may borrow Tolkien’s lexicon and aesthetics, Jackson’s film believes in his world. It does not merely entertain; it partakes in a mythology. That belief, that reverence, is what endures.');

i''m also disappointed with the casting decision for jared leto, his performance was fine but as a person i don''t exactly hold him in the highest regard, which made it difficult for me to look at his face the whole time like that. some of the pacing felt really campy, comic relief in weird spots from characters who really served no purpose. this issue didn''t exist in either previous film which really took me out of it this time.



scoring was great, trent did a great job. overall the film was very enjoyable and i would recommend for people who enjoyed the first tron film or legacy. but if you''re a superfan, don''t expect anything too spectacular.');

Such is the case with this latest installment in the “Tron” series of would-be sci-fi screen epics, a nondescript, underwhelming effort that, regrettably, disappoints in myriad ways. What starts out as a generally unengaging tale about AI corporate espionage that straddles life in the real world and cyberspace improves somewhat as it moves along, particularly in the back half when the connection to the original 1982 release becomes more apparent (and more compelling). But what precedes that development is uninspiring, even if it is visually dazzling to look at. Its attempt at conveying a cautionary tale about the potential dangers associated with artificial intelligence (not to mention the greedy, dimwitted purveyors of this dubious technology) may be laudable for its nobility and sincerity, but it’s not especially new at this point given the many other cinematic releases that have already tackled this subject (and better), perhaps best seen in several of the “Terminator” offerings. Arguably, the biggest problem here is an anemic script that generally tries mightily (though not always successfully) to link this picture’s narrative with its seminal roots, but it frequently feels as if it’s reaching for a suitably sufficient tie-in. That’s particularly apparent where a key story element is concerned, one that has been alluded to in previous installments but that is brought up directly this time – and that should have played a far more significant role in this iteration but that, sadly, is largely glossed over when introduced, receiving only scant treatment thereafter. The casting also leaves much to be desired, with gifted character actor Jared Leto being thrust into a part where his performance is about as appealing as a lukewarm bowl of porridge (with few prospects for greater, more meaningful depth and development); protagonist Greta Lee turning in a portrayal lacking in passion, interest and realistic believability; and Jeff Bridges essentially making an extended cameo that he could have just as soon phoned in (though, thankfully, Jodie Turner-Smith and Gillian Anderson are on hand to breathe some much-needed life into the otherwise-lackluster acting). Interestingly, this offering boasts an impressive original score by Nine Inch Nails, but its presence is so undeniable that it often tends to overpower the action that it’s meant to complement (I often found myself listening more intently to the background music than to the on-screen dialogue – an element that really shouldn’t be that obvious). To be honest, I can’t say that I hated director Joachim Rønning’s latest feature outing, but I certainly didn’t love it, either. In fact, the only reason I’d recommend seeing it on a big screen would be for the special effects, and, if that’s not justification enough for you to plunk down your hard-earned money for theater ticket prices, I’d suggest waiting until it comes to streaming and watch it at home.');

The Grid awaits once more, and its return is a welcome one. *TRON: Ares*, the long-gestating next chapter in the cult-favourite franchise, delivers exactly what the trailer promises: a breathtaking dive back into a digital world of light-cycle duels and identity-disc battles. It’s a spectacle for the senses that faithfully honors the legacy, even if its human heart sometimes gets lost in the neon glow.



**The Visuals and Sound Are the Real Stars**



Let''s be clear: this film is worth the price of admission for the aesthetic alone. Building on the foundation laid by *TRON: Legacy*, *Ares* pushes the visual envelope even further. The Grid feels more vast, more detailed, and more dangerous. The signature light-cycle sequences are more visceral and intelligently choreographed, and the disc wars have a satisfying, weighty impact that will please fans. The real standout, however, is the sound design and score. While no one can truly replace Daft Punk, the new musical team (or rumoured guest artists) have crafted a pulsating, electronic heartbeat that seamlessly blends nostalgic tones with fresh, aggressive synth-wave rhythms. It’s a triumph.



**A Compelling Premise with a Rushed Execution**



The story follows Ares (a perfectly cast Jared Leto), a powerful A.I. program sent from the digital world into our human reality—a clever inversion of the first film''s premise. The goal is one of peace and understanding, but as any *TRON* fan knows, nothing on The Grid goes according to plan. The philosophical conflict—what happens when a perfect digital consciousness confronts the messy, illogical nature of humanity?—is fertile ground.



The film is at its best when exploring this core idea. Leto brings a compelling, otherworldly quality to Ares, making him both empathetic and intimidating. However, the screenplay struggles to balance its high-concept themes with its blockbuster obligations. The human characters, including a weary corporate tech executive (played ably by a under-utilised Jodie Turner-Smith), often feel like narrative devices to move the plot along rather than fully fleshed-out people. The third act, in particular, rushes toward a climactic battle that, while visually spectacular, resolves the film''s central philosophical dilemma a bit too neatly.



**A Worthy, if Flawed, Entry**



*TRON: Ares* doesn''t reach the iconic status of the original nor the cult-cool heights of *Legacy*. It feels like a carefully crafted, slightly safe attempt to reignite the franchise. It does so with immense style and a clear love for the source material, but it stumbles in giving its human elements the same depth and complexity as its digital ones.



**The Verdict: 7/10**



*TRON: Ares* is a solid and entertaining sci-fi adventure. It delivers stunning visuals, a thumping score, and enough classic *TRON* action to satisfy devotees. While its story doesn''t fully explore the profound questions it raises, it successfully opens a new door to The Grid, leaving you hopeful and eager for the next round.



**See it if:** You''re a fan of the franchise; you crave a big-screen visual and auditory experience; you enjoy high-concept sci-fi, even when it prioritises spectacle over depth.

**Skip it if:** You demand deep character development from your blockbusters; you have no prior connection to the *TRON* universe.');

After “Morbius” (2022), I had hoped that Jared Leto might pick better, but after about ten minutes into this overlong and repetitive adventure I am afraid that proved not to be the case. Named after the Greek war god, he is a sophisticated computer programme that makes the “Terminator” look like “Barbie”. Virtually indestructible, he can penetrate any security system and therefore could prove to be invaluable to the military. Meantime, at a rival technology company they are working on the one thing that has thus far evaded all of the developers. Permanence. No matter how clever their inventions become, corporate nasty “Dillinger” (Evan Peters) knows that after half an hour their creations turn into Lego. He knows that rival “Eve” (Greta Lee) might be onto a solution and so he plonks “Ares” and his kick-ass sidekick “Athena” (Jodie Turner-Smith) into their system and so a cyberspace battle-royal ensues that tests the mettle and the “humanity” of just about all the players. I say players because that’s what this comes across as for much of it’s computer generated existence. Unlike the first “Tron” film from forty-odd years ago, this has very little by way of story and relies way too much on the, admittedly impressive, visual effects and high-octane pace of the thing rather than making any real effort to characterise the folks engaged in their venal and morally questionable corporate shenanigans. Quite why Gillian Anderson is here is anyone’s guess, Jeff Bridges looks as if he ought to be off parting the Red Sea and the writing is largely irrelevant, save for a little psycho-babble towards an ending that reminded me a little of “Max” from Disney’s “Black Hole” (1979).

It is a classical Hollywood product where the story is mostly there just as a vehicle for allowing the special effects team to do their business. As such it is a success.



The movie starts of with a display of action and the afore mentioned special effects with an attack by the Avengers on a bad guy stronghold. Not surprisingly the events sows the seeds for things to come.



The movie starts off with quite an interesting story idea with the activation of Ultron. However, once he materializes as a physical entity, it became a bit of seen that, been there and done that. Ultron just turns into yet another “standard” comic book villain a’ la Megatron running around trying to look intimidating while implementing his diabolical scheme. Okay, there was a bit of originality here and there but with the good start I kind of expected a wee bit more.



Having said that, the movie does indeed fulfil its purpose of showing off a bunch of super heroes slugging it out in a flurry of special effects and, although the story idea was perhaps not used as intelligently as I had hoped, it is not bad (for this kind of movie of course) and hangs together pretty okay. Sure, it is somewhat contrived and the means by which Ultron tries to exterminate humanity is overly complicated but it is still a decent story.

I’ve just returned from two back-to-back viewings of _Avengers: Age of Ultron_, and I do not regret one bit going in for that second helping.



I lost my steam on the _Age of Ultron_ wagon at a very inopportune moment. About three days before it came out. I was so heavily anticipating it for such a long time, that I was actually much more excited to see this movie when it was still two months away than I was waiting in line to get into the cinema it was playing at. The combination of the market-saturation and the fact that the _Ultron _hype-train has been running for literally years, with a first trailer dropping seven months before the damn thing came out, meant I got weary of the thing just a fraction too soon. But I’m a sucker for the MCU, and there was no way I was missing the sequel to my favourite superhero movie of all time.



I won’t harp on too much, because I don’t want to spoil anything (especially given that the movie isn’t even out in most parts of the world), I will put out a spoilertalk on this blog at some point down the line, but for now just let me leave you with a couple of quick thoughts.



_Age of Ultron_ is not the best film of all time. It’s not the best superhero film of all time, it’s not even the best MCU film. Honestly, I personally feel it’s not even the best MCU Phase 2 film. But it is still good. And that’s what’s important here. But what do I mean by that? 



Well, for starters, in and of itself, I loved it, a breach past an 80% approval rating from me is no small thing. The things we enjoyed from the first _Avengers_are here. The mesmerising action spectacles of course, but I more mean the character moments we got between the Avengers themselves, that was my favourite part of the first film and we get it here again in spades. 



Every new thing Joss has added to the plate works splendidly as well, real Hawkeye story, new heroes, a new villain, an updated world, all of these things are big ticks in lots of boxes.



So if everything from _The Avengers_ works and everything they’ve added works great too, why is _Age of Ultron_ not a perfect film? For spoiler-free purposes I will not go into detail, but that’s okay because the answer is quite simple: Everything in _Age of Ultron_ is great. It’s what’s not in _Age of Ultron_ that’s the problem.



Joss Whedon said that the film had to be cut by nearly an hour. That way you get more showings in, and that means more money. Now I’m not saying we need every minute of that hour back, but what we ended up being left with, was just enough for _Age of Ultron_ to be the _Thor: The Dark World_ of the _Avengers _franchise (it was a far superior film to _Dark World_, but hear me out). _Age of Ultron_ is little more than a holding pattern. The set-ups for future films take up too much time for the story to bear the weight of some actual story, but everything that occurs in the film itself somehow also has virtually no consequence on world it is a part of. I can’t say it more plainly than that: It’s a holding pattern. It introduces some stuff, but it doesn’t stand alone the first film did. It’s not such a big deal when the solo-movies do that (like the aforementioned _Dark World_) because we have _The Avengers_ films for those to pay off in. But when an _Avengers_ entry is just more of the same, I can’t fully get behind it.



That all said, _Age of Ultron_ is of course a lot of fun. A huge amount of fun, I can’t state that enough. And there’s literally nothing more important something in the entertainment industry can be. These are just the things holding it back from taking it up to the next level (or if I’m being completely honest, even taking it to the level the first film was at).

Yes, it’s bloody. Yes, the bad guys are inbred cannibals. But the cast is great, and the effects are also great for its time. You feel for these characters and their predicament.



PLOT



Five friends and a stranger, after a car crash, must survive in the woods while being hunted by inbred cannibals.



MY THOUGHTS



There’s roughly ten kills. I say roughly because “supposedly” two of the killers are killed, but since there are several sequels, we can assume they may have not died. The kills, the ones that are shown on screen, are bloody and good. Unfortunately there are a few that are shown off screen. I would say my favorite would have to be either Francine’s barbed wire death (to include the dismemberment later on) or Carly’s beheading.



The boring death would have to be either Evan’s, which is ear sliced off and Scott’s where he is just shot three times in the back with arrows. Neither were that interesting. I did feel bad for Scott since I actually like him. I could care less about Evan. He was annoying.



As far as acting goes, I think it was pretty decent. I found Eliza Dushku, Jeremy Sisto, Emmanuelle Chriqui, and Desmond Harrington did a good job with their characters, and I really felt for their characters.



Eliza Dushku (known for Soul Survivor, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, and Tru Calling) plays Jessie, a woman who recently ended a relationship. Her friends brought her out hiking to take her mind off of the breakup. Emmanuelle Chriqui (known for Crow: Wicked Prayer and Forever Knight) plays Carly, engaged to Scott, with wedding plans running through her head.



Jeremy Sisto (known for May, Nightmare and Dreamscapes, and Dead & Breakfast) plays Scott, Carly’s fiancee. And Desmond Harrington (known for The Hole, Taken, Ghost Ship, and the Neon Demon) plays Chris, the man late for a job interview who regrets taking a shortcut.



We start Wrong Turn with two college students rock climbing. When the young man gets to the top we hear what sounds like a struggle and then his body is thrown over the cliff. The girl’s rope is being pulled up so she cuts the rope and falls to the ground. She tries to get away, but is caught and killed off camera.



Next we meet Chris who is driving to what we assume is a job interview. He’s running late and there is a chemical spill on the road. He then decides to use a shortcut. He distracts himself and crashes into a jeep that is sitting on the side of the road. Here he meets 5 more people: Evan, Francine, Scott, Carly, and Jessie.



Jessie and her friends are on a hiking trip when they realize that their flat was caused by barbed wire that was purposely layed out in the road. Chris, Jessie, Carly, and Scott take off to find help, leaving Evan and Francine with the vehicles.



After messing around for a bit, Evan hears a noise and goes to investigate. After realizing he’s missing, Francine goes and looks for him. She doesn’t find him but she finds his shoe and his severed ear. She screams and tries to run off but is quickly captured and a barbed wire is stretched over her mouth and pulled. This causes her mouth to tear open, killing her.



Meanwhile the other four find a cabin and go in to investigate. They find various items, old and new, as well as body parts. Before they can leave, three people show up, so they hide. Chris and Jessie hide under a bed and Carly and Scott hide in a room with junk in it.



The three carry Carly’s body in and put it on the table and start dismembering and eating her! Their friends are horrified but are quiet until the three fall asleep. As they escape, Chris tries to distract the killers and they shoot him. So then Scott decides to distract the inbreds so Jessie and Carly can get Chris and steal the killer’s truck. They drive down a path hoping to find Scott. They see him and as he’s running to the truck the killers shoot him with three arrows, killing him.



The three drive off as the killers take Scotts body with them. They keep driving and find a ranger’s station/tower. They climb it, hoping for a radio and they find one but nobody answers when they call for help. Unfortunately for them, the killers see them and follow. When someone finally responds on the radio, the killers try to get into the room.

Unable to get to them they set fire to the tower. This causes Jessie, Chris, and Carly to have to climb out onto the tall trees. As they climb down, Carly is too scared to move, is caught by surprise and her head is chopped off with an ax!



Our final two, Chris and Jessie are able to cause one of the killers to get hit by a branch, and fall from the tree. They are able to escape, and hide in a cave until morning. They head out the next morning and finally see a road. Just then, the killers show up and push Chris down the hill. Jessie is captured and taken back to the cabin. She is chained to the bed, unable to escape.



Chris survives the fall and see’s a police officer. Before he can explain what is going on, the officer is shot with an arrow. Chris tries to take the vehicle but can’t find the keys. Instead, he hides under the killer’s truck, holding on while they leave to go back to the cabin with the officer’s body in the back.



Just before Jessie is killed, the front of the cabin is busted open when a vehicle bursts through, setting the cabin on fire. There’s a fight, but in the end Chris is able to blow up the cabin with the two killers inside. Jessie and Chris drive off.



As a note, there’s an end credit scene, so stay and watch it.



Overall, I think this is a great movie and a good cast. One of those kinds of movies that’s, yes bloody, and there’s killing, but you actually like the characters. You feel bad when some die or get hurt. I can’t say the same for the sequels though. So if you haven’t seen Wrong Turn, then you definitely should watch this.



And now for your Forever Final Girl Exclusive…Did you know?:



Emmanuelle Chriqui dislocated her shoulder performing her fall through the trees. You can hear her shoulder pop on the production track in the theatrical sound mix.



Several of the cast and crew were covered in poison ivy throughout the filming of the movie, this was due to the chairs being placed in what was first thought to be a group of weeds only later to be discovered as a patch of the rash causing plants.



During one of the last scenes in the movie, Eliza Dushku actually set actor Julian Richings (Three Finger) on fire.



When the four were running from the cabin after awakening the mountain men, Desmond Harrington broke his right ankle after landing on the opposite side of a log. This made it very difficult to shoot some of the scenes after his left leg is “shot” and he has to limp on his right leg.



Despite only being credited for his producing, Make-up master Stan Winston was pivotal in the key design of the Mountain Men, in particular now postmodern horror icon Three-Finger. This marks the second last major horror film he has been involved before his death in 2008 at age 62 and the third slasher horror film he had been involved in following unaccredited work in Friday The 13th Part II and III, the latter of which he had been a core designer on the original hockey mask of also horror icon Jason Voorhees and the respective mongoloid appearance of Jason for those two parts.



Screenwriter Alan B. McElroy also penned the script for the reboot Wrong Turn (2021).



Director Rob Schmidt said in the commentary that he considers this film to be his own personal tribute to the classics like Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974) and Hills Have Eyes (1977).



Kevin Zegers and Lindy Booth also appear together in the 2004 remake of Dawn of the Dead. In this film their characters are in a relationship and both die, however, in Dawn of the Dead their characters both survive and are assumed to have started a relationship by the end.



The only film in the series that does not contain any sex or nudity.



The female lead character, Jessie Burlingame, was named after the heroine in Stephen King’s novel, “Gerald’s Game”.



There’s an additional scene halfway through the end credits, showing the fate of a state trooper who discovers a body in the burned-down cabin.



Eliza Dushku did a lot of her own stunts for the movie.

It has flaws but it still delivered.  For instance, they didn''t really explore the loving side of Superman that is the reason for saving humans.  But i get it that this could just be a different interpretation of his motives. The relationship between Clark and Lois was almost spontaneous and didn''t really develop. Not to mention there was so much action! Sure this is Superman and he deserves a big movie, but that action is just so mind numbing and distracts from the plot. I really did like how they explored Clarks childhood just enough to give justification to his emotions. Although there are criticism about the ending, I thought it was well made. Clark spent his entire youth listening to his father to control himself and he had to learn to make a tough decision. I think this movie has a lot of potential for a sequel if they do it right. I look forward to being able to look back on this and watch it as part of a trilogy and not a stand alone film.');

Smart choosing to focus in Krypton. Probably, the less repeated story told about Superman.



You can really feel Christopher Nolan''s touch in the script and, probably, that''s the problem. It is just too similar to Batman Begins. Also, the script repeats Batman''s stupidities like the way in which Klark Kent father dies or feeling that Crowe, Superman''s father, has everything under control, even his own stupid death.



Tons of FX with incredible fights that may feel exhausting for some but that I think are totally justified in this character.



The OST is again in the hands of Hans Zimmer that keeps abusing of the drumming and grave sounds.

I am sure that a lot of people are not going to agree with me on this one but personally I was not overly thrilled with this movie.



Sure, if what you wanted was a wild action ride and unchecked destruction then this movie will most likely satisfy you. However, as a “Superman” movie it just did not feel right to me.



The original story is tweaked and tinkered with too much. The Kryptonians, not only General Zod and his minions, are portrayed in a quite negative light. Superman himself project a hugely negative aura. Lois Lane gets to meet Superman and learn who he really is before he even starts to work for The Daily Planet. And so on and so forth…



The first part of the movie with the back-flashes, with Kal-El just trying to hide, getting bullied etc. is just sad and even boring. It is not until General Zod arrives that things starts to get going. However even then they continue to tinker with things. Apparently it is now enough to breathe Krypton-like air for him to lose his powers. This is just so wrong. Actually, the entire bla bla when they try to “explain” his powers is just dumb. There is an established story behind Superman. Even though it is fantastic and unscientific just stick to it. It is a fantasy comic character after all. Leave it at that. The story itself is not bad but it is not Superman.



Having said all that, when the fighting starts, the special effects and the action definitely have a high “coolness factor”. Superman and General Zod wrecks more havoc than half a dozen Godzillas with a bad case of hangover. Actually the level of mayhem is bordering on the ridiculous but it was fun to watch.

(Indeed, in all the years I’ve watched movies theatrically, that’s been the case every time with just two exceptions.) And, regrettably, that’s very much the case in this final installment in this long-running franchise. To put it simply, “Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning” is an offering with a lot of problems, the biggest of which being the decision to split the story into two parts in the first place. As it stands, the narrative could have easily been condensed down to a single release. But, if the producers truly wanted to make two films to close out the franchise, they could have readily done so by making two distinct stand-alone pictures instead of trying to tie this offering to its predecessor, “Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning, Part One” (2023), considering that the nexus between them is tepid at best. As a consequence, though, this two-film package makes for a needlessly long 5½-hour story that could have been told in much less time with some judicious editing. This suggests that milking the box office had to have been a strong incentive for how this project ultimately played out. And, even if that wasn’t the case, the least the creators could have done was to tell a better story: While the first part did a reasonably capable job of holding viewer interest, that’s out the window here with its many well-crafted but decidedly overlong action sequences (a la the most recent “Indiana Jones” offering (2023)); a story that elevates comparatively minor characters to unexplained relevance; under-utilizes the talents of several gifted cast members (e.g., Nick Offerman and Janet McTeer) while leaving others out entirely (where’s Vanesa Kirby’s White Widow, a character who played a key role in the first part?); and requires comprehensive audience familiarity with both the franchise’s complete mythology, as well as in-depth knowledge of the intricacies of AI technology. Most importantly, however, many plot elements of the picture go beyond being “impossible” to “wholly implausible” or even “difficult to accept,” with numerous scenes that are full of holes, rely on convenient contrivances or seem completely unfathomable. “Final Reckoning” even “borrows” elements from other movie narratives (most notably “Fail Safe” (1964) and “Terminator 2: Judgment Day” (1991)) that strain its efforts at originality. There’s also an almost self-congratulatory aspect to the production thanks to the inclusion of numerous flashback clips to previous installments in the franchise, introduced with somewhat tangential tie-ins, a cinematic stroll down memory lane that adds little (the film’s inspired reintroduction and effective use of CIA operative William Donloe (Rolf Saxon) from the franchise’s first release (1996) notwithstanding). In the end, however, this release misses the mark in myriad ways, and that even includes a rather lame conclusion that comes across as stretched out and unsatisfyingly anticlimactic (and that could have been handled better and differently in several alternate scenarios). In my view, this collection of blatant shortcomings is not the way to wrap up a storied franchise like this. I firmly believe that it should have come to an end with the release of “Mission: Impossible – Fallout” (2018), handily the best of the eight features in this series. Indeed, going to the well one (or two!) too many times can tarnish a mythology’s legacy, and “Mission: Impossible” is one such venture. It genuinely deserves to go out with a bang and not a whimper. Unfortunately, though, in this case, the latter is the reality, and that’s truly a shame.');

Quickly, though, we are reminded that the entity (anyone see the “Forbin Project” from 1970?) is bent on seizing control of the world’s nuclear arsenals and using them to start a process of mutually assured destruction that will eradicate all life on Earth. Luckily “Ethan” (Cruise) has the magic key that might lead to humanity’s salvation, but he also needs the support of his erstwhile bosses, the President of the USA, an aircraft carrier and a nuclear submarine that actually works. Once we have waded through all the recaps the story kicks in with plenty of opportunity for our ingenious hero and his team - largely without Ving Rhames this time - to put together a series of cunning plays and counter-plays to keep themselves ahead of not just the megalomaniacal virus but also the malevolent “Gabriel” (Esai Morales) who reckons he might be able to take control. It’s essentially a vehicle for the star for the supporting efforts from the likes of Hayley Atwell and Simon Pegg offer us little of distinction, but if you’re a fan of action adventure movies then this is the equivalent of a higher-tech “Indiana Jones” movie with car chases; loads of pyrotechnics; great visual effects, an energetic score and it culminates with an enjoyable aerial dogfight that just needed the Red Baron and/or Sir Sean Connery. I am struggling to believe this is really the last of these, but if it is then it’s a fitting denouement for a character that has largely delivered well these last thirty years and that has has come along way from the Peter Graves stuff from the late 1960s.

You’d think a 170-minute movie would have plenty of time to waste, but Mission: Impossible - The Final Reckoning sprints out of the gate and doesn’t look back. For something that clocks in at nearly three hours, it’s almost shocking how quickly it moves. The story is intricate, packed with moving parts, but still surprisingly easy to follow. Credit goes to the sharp editing that threads everything together without losing momentum. It’s clear the filmmakers wanted this to feel like the culmination of Ethan Hunt’s thirty-year journey, and in many ways, they pull it off—though maybe not quite as hard-hitting as one might expect from a grand finale.



Of course, the real selling point here is the action. Tom Cruise once again takes every opportunity to play Mr. Show-Off with his stunt work, and honestly, I’m not mad about it. Whether it’s leaping off impossible heights, riding vehicles where no sane person would, or holding his breath longer than a Navy SEAL, Cruise continues to prove he’s Hollywood’s most committed daredevil. Sure, the Fast and Furious franchise gets ribbed for ridiculous, physics-defying set pieces, but let’s not kid ourselves—the Mission: Impossible films are guilty of the exact same thing. The difference is, these stunts are both insane and staged so well you can’t help but buy in.



The cinematography is nothing short of breathtaking. There are shots here that are simply jaw-dropping, and the underwater submarine sequence is a masterclass in tension. It’s one of those rare moments where I completely forgot the film’s narrative hiccups because I was so locked in. This is the kind of spectacle that demands the biggest screen possible, and it delivers on that front without question.



That said, there are issues. For one, the script leans heavily on exposition, so much so that I occasionally wanted to yell, “Enough talking, just throw Tom Cruise off another cliff already!” And while it’s fun to see familiar faces like Ving Rhames and Simon Pegg return, the film introduces so many additional characters that several of them feel like nothing more than pawns shuffled around the board. They’re there to keep the plot moving, not to give us anyone new to root for.



Then there’s the villain problem. Gabriel, played by Esai Morales, makes for a sinister presence, but his routine is frustratingly repetitive. He shows up, threatens or mansplains something, then disappears until the next scene, where he does the same thing again. It’s hard to feel the weight of the supposed ultimate adversary when his menace keeps fading into the background.



And that brings me to the finale. For a movie carrying the subtitle “The Final Reckoning,” it doesn’t quite land the emotional haymaker I was expecting. It’s still thrilling, still entertaining, but it doesn’t pack the kind of gut punch you’d hope for from the end of a thirty-year saga.



Even with those flaws, I can’t deny this is a wildly entertaining blockbuster. The tension, the stunts, the sheer spectacle—it’s everything you’d expect from a Mission: Impossible film, even if it stops just shy of greatness. Respect where it’s due: Tom Cruise keeps raising the bar, and for that alone, this ride is worth taking.');

I have two complaints. 



They give us two of Superman''s coolest villains: Lex Luthor and Bizarro, but lame versions of both. I was expecting something on par with Iron Man vs Ironmonger circa 2008, but Lex never dons his suit. I was pretty sure the masked villain was Bizarro, and later he''s revealed to be, but it would have been so much better if the authentic version had been written in.');

"Superman isn''t perfect. It struggles with pacing, has too many characters, and offers some clunky narrative solutions. But as the official cinematic introduction to the new DCU, it succeeds where it matters most: establishing the central pillars of the saga, giving us a worthy protagonist, and showcasing a filmmaker with a clear vision.



David Corenswet is the Superman this generation needs: a symbol of kindness, hope, and - above all - conviction-led action. Rachel Brosnahan and Nicholas Hoult round out a high-quality central trio, and even with its flaws, it''s hard not to leave the theater satisfied.



James Gunn delivers a clear statement of intent: DC''s future is in good hands. Bring on the rest of Chapter One: Gods and Monsters. If this is the path forward, maybe - finally - DC can fly as high as its greatest hero."

Much of that talk has specifically focused on whether certain franchises/mythologies have been overdone. That’s particularly true where the “Superman” mythos is concerned, a body of work that has assumed multiple forms on TV and the big screen since the 1970s. And, after viewing this latest iteration involving this storied and much beloved character, I can’t help but concur with the opinion that the man from the planet Krypton needs to be given a serious rest for a while. In my opinion, what has been called the biggest disappointment of this summer’s blockbuster season is an assessment that’s, unfortunately, right on target. In short, writer-director James Gunn’s latest is a hot mess that strains viewer interest not long into its overlong 2:09:00 runtime (a duration that honestly feels even longer than the official tally) and never manages to get it back. The biggest problem here rests with an overstuffed narrative that at times becomes challenging to follow, thanks to a screenplay that’s loaded with incongruities, rampant assumptions and a noticeable lack of back story; film editing tediously in need of much-needed snipping; overreliance on comic relief that grows progressively tiresome (especially with Superman’s annoyingly overzealous canine pal, Krypto); and an overall production whose vision is both tedious and not particularly original (especially in the rather ho-hum action sequences that we’ve seen so many, many times before in better films, most notably those from the Marvel Universe). In addition, the picture’s attempts at updating the nature of the Superman mythology for the present day are uneven at best, including some elements that are sufficiently contemporary with others that are woefully anachronistic (e.g., why are elements involving The Daily Planet newspaper portrayed in much the same way as they were in the past, given that today’s journalism business is a very different animal from what it was years ago?). To its credit, the film’s attempts at evolving the protagonist’s character into a paragon of “wokeness” (a source of much criticism in some circles) provides an intriguing spin on the nature of the Man of Steel – one very much in line with Superman’s traditional embodiment as a champion of “truth, justice and the American way” – even if it is somewhat excessive on occasion. That’s especially true where matters involving “aliens” (like Kal El himself) are symbolically demonized as threats to society, a less-than-subtle allusion to how many perceive today’s immigrants. However, the attempt at making the film’s hero more socially relevant is at times undermined by inconsistent character development, a problem that plagues many of this release’s other players, too. And that’s unfortunate in light of the performances on display, including a capable Christopher Reeve-esque portrayal by the film’s lead (David Corenswet), as well as fine supporting characterizations of mythology staples Lois Lane (Rachel Brosnahan) and Lex Luthor (Nicholas Hoult). In essence, though, “Superman” regrettably feels like an offering created by committee, a production that desperately should have gone through several more rounds of revisions before being committed to a final print. What’s more, if this picture was meant to lead off a new franchise involving this character, it comes up short all around, a prospect that doesn’t bode particularly well for the artistic future of this series. Superman deserves better than this, but that’s noticeably lacking in this release, one that, over time, is likely to become forgettable, particularly when measured against its superior predecessors, films that commendably and authentically depict its protagonist as a genuinely super-man.');

In fact there''s actually a lot to enjoy here and is easily the BEST live-action Superman movie since the Christopher Reeve era.



Corenswet as Superman/Clark is fucking amazing and the characterization of Supes would''ve been perfect if it weren''t for that one plot twist (more on that later). I also like that thay made a point but its more on his ACTIONS that define who you are. Hoult is also spectacular, you can just feel his hate and anger and those nasty little evil smirks everytime he wins against our boy in blue. Rachel Brosnahan is also fucking perfect as Lois Lane and her interactions with not only Clark but also the Justice Gang is pure comic Lois. And to top it all of, the action, score, and visual imagery are all very much comic book-esque and just straight up fucking beautiful to see. (Mr Terrific and Metamorpho are both so good and entertaining).



BUT there is one big twist here that 90% of the general audience won''t care about, but as a comic fan the twist just brings this movie down from like a 8-9/10 to a 6-7/10. That twist is just that BAD atleast for someone like me who is a big big Superman comic fan.



SPOILERS FROM NOW ON:



Now for the big plot twist. Making the House of El (Jor El and Lara) evil and Superman believing himself to be more human than alien was a really really bad choice. As i mentioned before, i know that the whole point is that Kal or Superman or Clark is more defined by his ACTIONS rather than his heritage. But to make them completely evil and have clark reject his heritage at the end (completely replacing his krypton parents with footage from his earth parents) just really sucks.



FIRST OF ALL the decision to make them evil just ruins the immigrant allegory. If you''ve read the comics you would know that Clark is a deeply lonely guy. Having to grow up knowing you''re an alien, is different from everyone else and would constantly need to hide his powers and true self. He is afraid of being REJECTED and is the reason why he constantly yearns for his home planet krypton, a place where he could actually feel like himself and not some outsider. So to make his whole origin planet evil?? is not really helping the immigrant allegory. Like imagine if your an immigrant to the USA and suddenly in the news everyone says that your home country and everyone from there is fucking evil. STRAIGHT UP XENOPHOBIA. And to say that Clark wouldn''t care about his parents and origin planet because he didnt know them is stupid. I think that Learning your father was a man who tried but failed to save a world that wouldn''t listen to him would definitely have an impact on a guy who''s trying to save the world everyday.



A comic issue that showcased his loneliness and fear of rejection from humans is ACTION COMICS #794 where we see Clark in his adolescence watching a film with his friends, wherein the aliens are the villains and everyone around him js cheering for the aliens to go back to their planets. Imagine the pain and loneliness you would feel knowing that everyone around you even your friends just want you to go the fuck away.



Also this is exactly why his origin needs to be truly adapted because thats where his character, morality, and such really shine. It''s not only where his identity crisis and loneliness are explicitly explored but also where we see that it is not only his actions that define him but also the synthesis of all his experiences juggling his alien and human side. It also adds layers to his eventual rivalry with Lex, and shows his relationship with other super powered beings like the Legion.



In relation to that, this is also why SUPERBOY is important to be shown/adapated because its with his heroics as a teen that led to him meeting other heroes mainly the Legion of Superheroes. His adventures with the Legion is where he truly finds who he is, because like him they''re also teens going through the same problems. With the legion he finally got a community where he doesn''t have to hide anything, can share his problems that no other human can get and most importantly feel less LONELY and feel VALIDATED knowing that a future where superpowered beings are accepted actually exist.



(Also quick side note, this is also why him dating and losing his virginity to mermaid Lori Lemaris is so important to me. Sex and Intimacy is often done with someone you can be vulnerable with, and a mermaid or another kryptonian Lyra Lerrol be his first time is just so fitting. ADAPT SUPERBOY AND LORI PLEASE)



Him yearning for his kryptonian heritage also doesnt make him less human. Because why else would he still choose and create his secret identity/persona Clark Kent if he wants to reject it. Clark is his own guilty little pleasure of living as a human because even if he is an alien it shows that he still enjoys earth and cherishes humanity and its culture. He is supposed to be the BEST of both worlds and having him be one sided makes him a FAR LESS interesting character.



Again im going to reiterate this making him more human just removes too much LAYERS.



Another reason why his origin needs to be adapted is his relationship with Lex Luthor. In Smallville and other iconic comics such as Birthright, Secret Origin, and most recently Last Days of Lex. In these stories a young clark is often shown to have a brief childhood friendship with Lex. Like Clark, Lex always felt alone as a child. He was a science nut and was always interested in the larger universe of extra terrestrials and the like. People constantly saw and bullied him as a weird freak, and everytime he tried to help others people would just reject him. Clark was the only one who tolerated and protected him leading to their "friendship"

But Lex''s obsession with the larger universe led to his failed experiment and eventual downfall. He tried to create a machine to find and/or communicate with extra terrestrial life but it exploded and almost killed a ton of people. This led to further rejection from the people of Smallville and made him think that people would always see him as a freak just because he thought bigger and wanted to create science for a better tomorrow. This rejection then of course made him angry, resentful, and didnt care who he stepped on as long as he got his way.



And Clark feels guilty, because if Clark just told him who he really was then maybe Lex wouldn''t have turned out evil. If Lex just had a friend who not only matched his intellect but also understood his experiences of being outcasted and then maybe, just maybe both of them together could have used their powers to save and create a better tomorrow for everyone. With this context in mind the rivalry becomes more complex. Superman isnt trying to just stop Lex simply because he''s evil. He''s also just trying to save his friend.



There are a lot more things that i dont like in the film but this where my main points really stop. My other complaints like Jimmy not being a weird lovable dork enough (he''s just too regular) and most of the Daily Planet just being caricatures of their comic selves and Clark just having one scene are all really minor nitpicks that can be solved with future movies and adventures.



But again as i said in the beginning despite all my long ass complaints there''s still a lot to enjoy in this film. And i cannot deny that there is clearly heart in here and is easily still the best Supes movie since Christopher Reeve. It''s just the Evil Els that really ruined it for me.



LASTLY Kara having a cameo at the end kinda breaks the movie in half. Like bro, if you really think the El''s are evil then why do you still like your cousin? why do you still wear the House of El logo? like bro your cousin is a living example of the footage being straight up wrong lol.



Look, it may look like im a hater right now but i genuinely just wanted to love this movie. There are so much scenes here that made the comic book fan in me just smile and cheer like crazy. But the flaws were just way too big for me and it really muddled my experience. I just want Superman, my favorite comic character of all time to be adapted well. And yes while this is definitely the best Adaptation since 1978, it just didn''t hit for me. If you''re a comic fan or just a movie fan in general im sure you''ll still find enjoyment in this because the whole movie is still very fuckin endearing and action packed. But yeah for now, im sticking to the comics. Peace.');

I had seen snippets from a few trailers for this and, in truth, wasn''t really vibing with it back then. The lead actor seemed a bit underwhelming, the dialogue felt lousy and Lex Luthor came across over the top. I''m pleased to say, null of those things are true.



David Corenswet is an ace Superman, he fits the role to perfection. Again, I did like Henry Cavill''s stint as the eponymous Kryptonian, though I do reckon Corenswet does ever so slightly outdo him. It''s silly of me to even compare to be honest, given my appreciation for both.



For me, Nicholas Hoult is just as big a plus. This is the best of him I''ve seen, given I''ve never been fully convinced. Don''t get me wrong, I''ve liked performances from him, but almost always with an asterisk of sorts attached in my mind. No such issues here, he is fantastic as Lex.



Rachel Brosnahan and Edi Gathegi also dazzle, the latter''s character is especially interesting as I never knew he existed before this - hope to see more! Anthony Carrigan, Nathan Fillion and Isabela Merced also manage to stick out, which is impressive. All those onsceen are good.



The story is a surpremely entertaining one. I like how they skipped over the origins of Superman, the vast majority of viewers already know the backstory so it''s not needed - and for those that don''t, a simple short overview, as seen here, is more than enough to get the point across.



As for everthing else? The pacing, the visuals, the special effects, the music... all excellent. I, somewhat unexpectedly, have zero issues with this one, I thoroughly had fun with it and would happily revisit it at any time.');

This film borrows heavily from the 70''s Superman franchise. Its look, its feel, right down to costumes, harks back to that era. As does, the very simple, down to earth main character, capably played by  David Corenswet. I personally, could not but recall Christoper Reeve, in his performance.



This is Superman as he was mean''t to be. No cynicism, no divisive woke politics, just a good guy doing his best. Its this innately appealing character and those around him, that make this film function. Because lets be honest, whilst its an entertaining romp, the script is, in my estimation "chaotic". Its literally all over the place, doing too many things at once. That said, if you view those scenes in isolation, a good portion, are both enjoyable and amusing. For example, Lex Luthor, getting his comeuppance, from Superman''s cousins, kooky Superdog. 



In summary, no "Superman" 2025 is not a perfect film. That said, in a world that''s become cynical and divisive, the simple, honest, likeability of this film shines though in a way that''s impossible to ignore. For my money, well worth a look.');

I suppose it was only a matter of time before “Superman” got dragged (literally) into the multiverse. This time it is the DC one that’s being used by the evil “Lex Luthor” (Nicholas Hoult) who has quite a grudge against our red-caped hero. That’s because “Soop” (David Corensweet) recently intervened in a war to assist a small agrarian nation from being invaded by it’s nasty militarised neighbour. With access to his enormous resources, “Luthor” manages to penetrate the secret Antarctic fortress of our well-meaning protector to find not only his deepest secrets but also to kidnap his energetic dog “Krypto” - thus luring his quarry into the aforementioned “pocket universe” where the ultimate super-max prison contains many whom the planet doesn’t know what do do with any more, and a few ex-girlfriends. What chance he can escape through a complex sequence of portals (think “Stargate”)? Well that is largely down to his tenacious on/off girlfriend “Lois” (Rachel Brosnahan) who is entirely aware of her beau’s double identity, and to a tech whizz (Edi Gathegi) from another group of meta humans called the “Justice Gang” run by the “Green Lantern” who occasionally help out when the relentless stream of aliens descend on Metropolis. Now the scene is set for a really weak, repetitious and entirely derivative series of thwack and pow adventures that had me looking at the ceiling just once too often. Gene Hackman was always going to take some beating as “Luthor” but why use a British actor at all, and then make him use an entirely unnecessary American accent before giving him lines that make him sound like a frenzied bingo-caller? What’s with the dog? Aw, bless, but really? It just goes to show how remarkably ordinary “Superman” has become in a world so completely dominated by technology and people with far greater superpowers. Corensweet tries quite hard, is easy on the eye and he has some charm to him, but nobody else really has enough to get their teeth into and just by shaving Hoult’s head you don’t make him menacing. He isn’t in the least. There is cheesy sentiment all over this CGI-fest of a film that has a passing similarity to Ezra Miller’s “The Flash” from 2023. Sure, it moves along quickly but when you start to create cracks in what made a superhero super in the first place, you have to be able to infill with some serious attempts at action characterisation - not slushy dog-loving, baby/girlfriend-saving ones. No such development happens here and after the final denouement - there are a few goes at that - I left the cinema thinking this was an huge victory for style over substance and that this fella isn’t so much super as flawed: physically and emotionally. That wasn’t what I wanted to see. It’s a family film that can offend no-one and that looks great on a big screen, but I was distinctly disappointed, sorry.');

INSERT INTO [dbo].[review] (created_at, movie_id, user_name, rating, content) VALUES ('2025-07-26T12:48:39.616Z', 58, 'Unknown', null, N'The version of Superman in James Gunn’s film differs from past film iterations of the character. In other films, Superman is a one-man powerhouse. He is the only one who can save the day, and there is no plan B if he happens to lose. Maybe other heroes exist in that cinematic universe, but a major team doesn’t come together until a later film, and those other heroes are busy keeping people safe in their neck of the woods.



In the 2025 version of Superman, the film begins with Superman losing for the first time. The story Gunn wants to tell is how Kal-El faces the challenge of not only losing, but continuing to lose nearly everything that he holds dear. Superman gets his ass kicked throughout the film and barely scrapes by in fights.



Superman reintroduces color to superhero films after what felt like an eternity of a more serious comic book movie era, where everything tried to be serious and washed out in color. Superman feels like opening an old issue of Action Comics or a Superman comic from the 90s. Colors are bright and radiant to an extent that feels almost cartoonish, like a comic book.



Lex Luthor (Nicholas Hoult) has a plan that results in the entire world turning on Superman and Luthor being in control of the United States when it comes to interacting with metahumans (humans with superpowers) and whether they pose a threat or not. Superman disappears after being taken captive, and it’s up to Lois Lane (Rachel Brosnahan) and Mister Terrific (Edi Gathegi) to save him.



I’ve never been a huge fan of Superman. The original 1978 film, Zack Snyder’s Man of Steel, and Superman: The Animated Series from the late 90s are the highlights of the character for me. In Gunn’s film, David Corenswet doesn’t specifically add anything new to the character that we haven’t seen before. That’s not ragging on Corenswet’s performance, but it seems to be how the Superman character is.



He is a god among men, and the thing that makes him special is that he not only cares about the human race, but also views himself as human, because despite being an alien, he also makes mistakes. Corenswet delivers that bold sense of hope Superman is known for and is the embodiment of the modern version of the character.



It feels like Gunn knew that Superman’s straightforward demeanor couldn’t carry the film, and that’s one of the reasons why he surrounded him with so many supporting characters. Gunn has made a career of giving the spotlight to losers, outcasts, and characters who never should work together but are either forced to or feel like the family they’ve never been able to have once they’re all together.



Lex Luthor has a short fuse in this film, but that fuse turned to ash eons ago. He is seething with his hatred for Superman. He is envious of Superman’s popularity, but also hates the fact that he isn’t from this planet. Nicholas Hoult goes completely unhinged in his performance, but the scary aspect is that the average person can either see red and let themselves give in to rage or think logically and sensibly while thinking about what comes next. Lex not only does both of those things in Superman, but he is almost always two or three steps ahead of everyone else in the film.



Ultraman and The Engineer (Maria Gabriela de Faria) work for Lex Luthor and do all of the heavy lifting and fighting for Lex. The Engineer has a suit made from nanotechnology, while drones operated by drones control Ultraman to do Lex’s bidding. The Justice Gang – consisting of Guy Gardner (Nathan Fillion), Mister Terrific, and Hawkgirl (Isabela Merced) – handles heroic matters when Superman has his hands full. Guy is this universe’s version of Green Lantern, Mister Terrific is an inventor who uses his high-tech gadgets to fight crime, and Hawkgirl can fly and swing heavy weapons or something.



The film devotes a huge portion of its story to Ultraman, while The Engineer and Hawkgirl are strong female characters without much to do. The inclusion of The Engineer is said to be building towards a film centered around The Authority, but Hawkgirl is kind of forgettable as a character. She has a memorable scene near the end of the film, but the character as a whole isn’t developed at all.



For a James Gunn film, the humor is toned way down in comparison to his other films. Nathan Fillion’s Guy Gardner embodies Gunn’s typical comedy with a charming sense of juvenile obnoxiousness that you can’t help but love. Gunn’s other films, specifically the Guardians of the Galaxy films and the Suicide Squad, were fueled by constant bickering. There’s a sequence where Lois interviews Clark as Superman that feels like it’s attempting to add weight to Gunn’s fascination with comedic arguing and succeeds for the most part.



Metamorpho (Anthony Carrigan) is one of the more unique characters with some of the most visually impressive sequences in the film, and Krypto is a national treasure. It’s wild that Jimmy Olsen (Skyler Gisondo) is the biggest player of Metropolis, as every woman wants a piece of that.



James Gunn’s Superman rips the hope away from Superman and focuses on the real possibility of him not being able to save the day or even be the hero that people want to save them. Superman can eventually overcome impossible odds, but it’s earned, and nearly every supporting character is given the chance to contribute.



Superman is goofy, hopeless, and rewarding in all of the best ways. Some characters aren’t given as much time as others, but it feels like James Gunn is attempting to build a DC Universe full of interesting characters that are not only worthy of being on screen but deserve to be there.');

Zack Snyder`s Lex wanted Superman & Batman to fight each other but Gunn`s Superman movie''s plot centers on Lex Luthor’s "Evil" scheme to tarnish Superman’s public image, instead of killing him. Why are villains in modern movies so weak & pathetic that they themselves can`t fight the heroes on their own! Instead of giving us great Justice League cameos, we got gratuitous Justice Gang cameos. 



The cinematography is terrible and distracting. The score & music/songs were awful and uninspiring. I hated what they did with the superman theme. James Gunn seems to be much more interested in making a MCU Superman film. Future of DC is in more danger than ever before. 



If James Gunn actually wanted to comment on Israel-Palestine conflict, then he would have used the real names instated of made-up fake country''s name.  



After watching James Gunn''s Superman, I have a newfound appreciation for Zack Snyder''s Man of Steel.');

The cast is strong, and to be fair, not a single actor delivers a bad performance. The problem lies entirely behind the camera: James Gunn.



Once again, Gunn directs as if he only knows how to make one kind of movie. What we get doesn’t feel like a bold reinvention of the Man of Steel — it feels like the same film he’s been making for years, just with different costumes. In every one of his projects, he throws in monsters that look more like oversized pets than genuine threats, stripping away any sense of menace. And instead of focusing on iconic heroes that audiences actually care about, he leans on strange, second-rate characters — names like Mr. Terrific or Guy Gardner — that nobody outside comic-book diehards is interested in. This has been his trademark since Guardians of the Galaxy, when he first turned a group of unknowns into his personal playground.



Let’s be clear: there’s a difference between a director leaving his personal stamp on a film and a director simply repeating himself. Gunn does the latter. Guardians of the Galaxy, The Suicide Squad, Peacemaker — it’s always the same movie with a different label.



If that formula were brilliant, maybe repetition would be welcome. But the “Gunn formula” is shallow, clumsy, and exhausting. I had hoped that after so many missteps DC has taken with its recent films, this reboot would finally be different. Unfortunately, it isn’t.');

In hindsight my excitement for Spectre seems a bit foolish. After Skyfall, director Sam Mendes openly stated that he wouldn’t direct another Bond movie. And even so, Skyfall wasn’t the best of the new Bond films by any measure – dragging on for much too long. But somehow I got sucked into the hype of Mendes’ vision for an homage to the classic Bond, with that somewhat iconic poster of Craig mimicking Roger Moore, and trailers the emphasized a kind of retro re-visitation of some old villains and themes. But Spectre is null of those things, instead it is a film where everyone involved feels like they are just going through the motions. Spectre tries very hard to be an homage to the vintage James Bond classics, but instead ends up feeling more like a mockery of the series.



For starters the script is outrageously weak and predictable. Bond goes from shootout, to chase, to sex scene, saying and doing the exact same things he has done for the last 23 movies. Instead of a complete story, the film is just a collection of set pieces and scenes loosely stitched together. And while some of them work well on their own, by the second or third fight scene, you won’t be able to stop yourself from yawning. When you aren’t yawning you’ll be laughing, and not in a good way. The dialogue is downright cheesy. Gone is all of Bond’s smooth charm and ability to sting his opponent’s with his tongue just as much as with his gun. Instead at one point, he throws a watch bomb and says: “Time flies!”



Bond is one a secret mission, assigned to him by M (Judi Dench) via a video message delivered after her death. The film doesn’t ever attempt to invest the audience in this mission, or in Bond’s motivation for seeking out Oberhauser (Christoph Waltz) – which apparently has something to do with his foster-father and his childhood, again – but it never seems important to the story or to James. Meanwhile, a new joint secretary, Max or C as he is known (Andrew Scott), is attempting to unite the world’s intelligence under one surveillance network – and through doing so making the Double-0 program obsolete. Lucky for him, Sam Mendes is already doing that for him.



However, Spectre is a beautiful film. There are about five or six huge set pieces, all of which are wonderfully filmed. And if you are just in the mood the veg out and watch Bond cruise through the streets of Rome in a prototype Aston Martin, than this is the movie for you. But things go on for entirely too long, which would be fine if something of interest were happening. But almost nothing does. Bond gets in a situation and gets out, all while throwing a few pithy, laughable, lines out.



Daniel Craig has never been more disconnected from the character James Bond, than he is in Spectre. I must say first, that I love Craig as an actor and as James Bond – he is my favorite of all the Bonds. But here, he is uncharacteristically not James Bond. A scene for instance where bond throws his gun into the river, is done in such a fancy foppish way that I cringed. It is tough to properly convey how Craig misses the mark in Spectre, but when you see it, you won’t be able to help feeling the same way.



Maybe Sam Mendes and screenwriter John Logan did succeed at creating a perfect homage to the Roger Moore era Bond films? Because in reality, null of those films standout as great movies. From start to finish, Spectre feels like someone filling out a madlibs of Bond scenes, and praying that when they read it back, it makes some sense.');

INSERT INTO [dbo].[review] (created_at, movie_id, user_name, rating, content) VALUES ('2015-11-08T04:47:53.765Z', 59, 'Unknown', null, N'Well, cinema’s most treasured and resilient British spy guy is back as the legendary James Bond makes his twenty-fourth outing on the big screen in the highly anticipated and slickly-made Spectre. Worldwide Agent 007 fans understandably maintain their embedded expectations and vision as to what calculating and cunning mission their suave and sophisticated gun-toting, martini-sipping espionage thrill-seeker will encounter in his latest globe-trotting episode. Whatever Bond enthusiasts have in mind for the future twenty-fifth entry of the “licensed to kill” Lothario they should simply settle for the present stimulating currents that trickle as mind-bending material in the polished and percolating Spectre.



As for the dynamic performer that have served his time with action-oriented cinematic sensibilities through three previous super-charged James Bond installments, the steely-jawed and diligent Daniel Craig is back on the saddle again for his fourth stint as the crafty 007. Naturally both ardent and casual Bond followers can rattle off the filmography of Craig’s on-screen tour of duty as the debonair and daring secret service operative and even rate the previous films as they compare and contrast each edition.  Some may give special attention to Craig’s first foray into stepping inside Bond’s explosive shoes for 2006’s Casino Royale that is considered a spectacular introduction for the dramatically trained actor. In 2008’s Quantum of Solace, it was a mixed bag at best as Bond followers for the most part gave this second 007 rendition an ambivalent sign of approval (not too many were thrilled with the awkward movie title either). Thankfully, 2012’s Skyfall bounced back for Craig’s take on the roguish Bond and made for some exceptional brownie points as the cagey spy returning to creative prominence. Now 2015’s Spectre hopes to make some hearty tie-ins to Craig’s past big screen adventures as the stoic jet-setting dynamo ridding the world of masterful riff raff.



In actuality, Spectre is serviceable in that it is an elaborate and excitable reminder of the preceding Bond films where bits of nostalgic elements from yesteryear are sprinkled throughout its presentation. Sure, some wily 007 fanatics may spot a few of the tossed in nods to the aforementioned Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace in particular as the proceedings unfold. For the most part, Spectre acts as a mere bridge to the launching of the upcoming 25th Bond actioner in waiting. To be fair the other Bond films have served as a welcome mat to the next chapter of the late Ian Fleming’s engaging and charismatic man of action so why should not Spectre be any different in this regard? Still, this spy caper has its signature swagger that Bond aficionados relish with familiarity: heart-pumping action sequences, exquisite locales, desirable and devious Bond women, majestic car chases, larger-than-life villains and their loyal henchmen, imaginative gadgets and inventive technology and yes…the indomitable James Bond at your service. Nevertheless. the minor knock on Spectre is that it could have risen to the occasion more than it did as it occasionally feels as if it is going through the mischievous motions. It never resorts to the levels of Bond-ish drudgery in Quantum of Solace so that certainly is a relief in that aspect.



Spectre does incorporate its share of opulence, mystery, suspense, shadowy tension and perilous plight. However, where the standard Bond film-making characteristics are somewhat consistent and captivating (i.e. the breathtaking opening sequence of the Day of the Dead celebration in Mexico City) there is also a questionable consideration for the weak-kneed Bond theme song in Sam Smith’s “Writing’s on the Wall” which seems so inadequately suited for a James Bond signature tune. Even the indifferent observers of the James Bond film franchise for the last five decades can attest to the two most important stamps of a Bond film–its opening scene and surging theme song.  Thankfully, Spectre’s grand opening sequence obeys traditional Bond practices but Smith’s doggedly tired-sounding “Writing’s on the Wall” feels as it belongs attached to an old televised After School special from the mid-70s. Wouldn’t you give your kingdom for Paul McCartney and Wings’ “Live and Let Die” or Carly Simon’s “Nobody Does It Better” or perhaps even Sheena Easton’s “For Your Eyes Only”?



One thing that can be said about Craig’s Bond in Spectre and that is his image transformation has been elevated to that of a fashion plate whose GQ stylized look has taken quite a step up. Not since Roger Moore’s Bond has there been a clear case of dazzling attire on display for Agent 007 to strut his stuff in spiffy clothing accessories throughout his ventured travels. Craig, billed as a “blue-collar” Bond whose demeanor is more blunt and workman-like, takes comfort in basking in the finesse shadows of a classic Agent 007 almost foreign to his distinctive spin on the iconic spy. In fact, the overall vibe for Spectre seems to lie in the middle of old school and new school James Bond mythology where the shading suits both camps of the ever-lasting film franchise.



Director Sam Mendes, who handled the direction for the previous Skyfall, finds the right tone and temple for Spectre that certainly shows off its lavish and ambitious production values as the set designs, scenic locations, fabulous pre-credits action sequence are all indescribable in majestic scope. No one can accuse Spectre as to not holding its own in visual functionality. Wisely, Mendes does not forget his Skyfall background players as they reunite with Craig’s Bond and partake in the sensationalized cat-and-mouse caper. It is refreshing to see Ralph Fiennes back as “M” not to mention Ben Wishaw’s “Q” front and center. And a Craig-fronted Bond film would not be the same without Naomie Harris as Miss Moneypenny.



Agent 007 fans will find a common "Bond" with Daniel Craig and his fourth outing as the licensed to kill Lothario in the stunning and kinettic SPECTRE

Agent 007 fans will find a common “Bond” with Daniel Craig and his fourth outing as the licensed to kill Lothario in the stunning and kinetic SPECTRE

It is a given that the diabolical criminal network known as SPECTRE has always had its affiliation with the Bond universe especially in the classic Sean Connery Bond-age years. Instinctively, SPECTRE’s evil heart and soul was pumped continuously by that organization’s dastardly mastermind Ernst Stavro Blofeld. Oscar winner Christoph Waltz does the sordid honors of taking the reins as Bond’s nemesis Franz Oberhauser in Spectre with devilish delight and is more colorfully corrupt thanks to his handy go-to muscular minion Mr. Hinx (ex-professional WWE wrestler and “Guardians of the Galaxy” star Dave Bautista) echoing the memories of beloved brute Jaws (played by the late Richard Kiel) from The Spy Who Loved Me and Moonraker). 



We can never forget that along with Agent 007 folklore comes the responsibility of being labeled a treasured Bond babe. And although the latest sultry women represented in Spectre will never make us forget the iconic likes of Dr. No’s Ursula Andress (Honey Ryder) or Casino Royale’s Eva Green (Vesper Lynd) for that matter they still hold their own and give a measure of titillation to both Bond and the vast amount of male admirers wishing they carried a gun and wore expensive tuxedos while being at the receiving end of a provocative smooch by these vibrant vixens. Lea Seydoux’s Madelene Swann and Italian siren Monica Bellucci’s Lucia are on board as the Bond bombshells for hire.



As a whole, Spectre has its up and down moments and never is quite sure about standing alone as an independent Bond story or being dismissed as a pit stop for 007-related flashbacks and reference bits ode to yesteryear’s glory of the super spy’s engaging and raging exploits. The verdict is that Spectre ultimately satisfies one’s craving for the invincible James Bond whether you can to relive his vintage reputation or look forward to a millennium-enhanced production that will grow with the ageless wonderment pertaining to Fleming’s literary ladies man-turned movie-making mainstay of action-packed cinema for half a century. As one-time Bond songbird Carly Simon would attest in her soothing lyrics, “nobody does it better…”  Yet in the dimensional escapist world of James Bond this particular go-around could have been a tad bit better.

What I liked from a couple of last Bond movies was they were off the regular 007 style, like not overly rely on spy''s special gadgets. This change has been since the day one of Daniel Craig as a famous British spy, James Bond. Anyway, he''s the most fittest (muscular) Bond I''ve ever seen and he''s celebrating 10 year anniversary with this film release. But the question is whether he to do another film or done with the franchise. The doubt after the confusing end of this film.



The end was quite clear on the story perspective, so I kind of felt it was a farewell for Craig. But, later I came to know that the official source says Bond25 will be his fifth and so on till he opts out himself. ''Spectre'' was a very simple Bond movie I have ever seen, but I can say the production quality was so good that you can''t resist the enjoyment. The actors, they were also good, but not as I anticipated. Maybe many scenes were very ordinary for a Bond movie, that''s comparable with the nowadays action movies, otherwise it was not as bad as critics expressing their disappointment.



You can''t believe what I was disappointed, you know when they say what the C stands for - is that the best word they come up with against the M for Moron? Anyway, James Bond movies have always had ups and downs, the last film ''Skyfall'' was a mega hit and now this has not stood up to that standard. But very entertaining with all the actions and unexpected turns in the narration. As a spy movie, it was okay, but as a Bond movie is what might upset you, so its upto you how you look at it. But to be honest, I enjoyed it.

"Spectre fails to reach the tremendous potential of its intriguing narrative and fascinating antagonist, but Sam Mendes still pulls off a decent James Bond flick.



The screenplay raises significant issues with an incredibly dull subplot that deeply affects the pacing of a bloated runtime. In addition to this, Christoph Waltz''s lack of impactful screentime is disappointing, to say the least, despite a brilliant performance from the actor.



Fortunately, the jaw-dropping action set pieces elevate the overall film, which also benefits from gorgeous cinematography (Hoyte van Hoytema) and exceptional acting across the board. Daniel Craig and Léa Seydoux''s characters relationship is emotionally compelling, making Bond''s mission feel more like an interesting personal journey.



One of the best movies of the franchise is buried somewhere under the messy screenplay, but what can be found at the surface has much to appreciate."

She - "Madeleine" (Léo Seydoux) may well know how to help him thwart the ambitions of this secretive and deadly organisation before it is all too late. There are plenty of (extended) action scenes here and the gadgets work well enough, but the story is thin and the characterisations lacking. The dynamic lacks jeopardy - we know who is likely to be behind the cunning plots right from the start and neither Fiennes nor Scott bring much to the party. Indeed the latter is really rather poor. What menace there is, is delivered via some underwhelming contributions from Dave Bautista''s "Hinx" and from the appearances of Christoph Waltz, but they are all too infrequent to bolster the storyline before an ending that was, frankly, ridiculous - even by "Quantum of Solace" (2008) standards. The producers seem to be constantly trying to reinvent "Bond" without realising that the more they compromise the standards of the story and weaken the traditional characters, the less impact the franchise has when surrounded by many others of this genre that benefit from stronger writing and a more charismatic star.

I mean Christoph Waltz is a great actor, but even he couldn''t find his footing in that mess of a story.



The action was never suspenseful or even really enjoyable...

After the incredible bombastic success of Skyfall, the return of Sam Mendes, and the announcement of Christoph Waltz as the villain, expectations skyrocketed to ridiculous heights. Unfortunately, these expectations climbed too high for Spectre to meet. While the story did a decent job of trying to tie all the Craig Bond films together and introduce a new supreme criminal mastermind, it didn''t fully satisfy or carry the weight it intended. There were some exceptional action sequences, with the opening scene in Mexico City as one of the most stunning and impressive of the franchise. The train fight with Dave Bautista was incredibly entertaining as well, but much of the action felt restrained like Craig was tired of the role and didn''t want to push the boundaries on some stunts.

Spectre is a great spy movie and a fun Bond flick, but unfortunately, it didn''t live up to the level of hype and expectation set before it.

Namely, that they don''t work, because 007 is about action, exotic sceneries, cinematic brilliance, beautiful women, gadgets that go wrong or right, and most of all the wit and charm and atmosphere.

I''m not sure when the forma should have changed from exciting to dull, probably around 1995, but it changed before that year.

And it should have changed in a productive and interesting way. 

Instead, it changed to just total dullness with not one good aspect. The motivation of characters other than 007 is total zero in credibility. The inspiration is zero. The strategy is zero. The dialog is clumsy.

This is to be expected from the changes around 1970, when the writer''s guild became immensely jealous of talent and good writing, and only produced the writers with zero talent.

And now those writers are the "judges" of new writers, God help this culture.

The change in format should have changed long ago, about 1995, into "sons and daughters of 007", with 007 as a background figure, say fifth or sixth billing, with his sons and daughters taking center stage in this "less action, more computer" world.

A lot of us said this well before 1995. It was painfully obvious, but we live in a world where Hollywood went total hack in the seventies, with those hacks endorsing the worst hacks of today.

"Spectre" kind of gives us an introspective look at this with the timeline element. Bond faces the usual super enemy power, and fights the establishment which brings in the computer age.

The character of 007 is the only thing that is salvaged in these new movies. It isn''t Daniel Craig''s fault that he is 007 for the worst writers, writers who are into the neo Nazi ideology of the seventies where women must be blond and pale, and any man who tries to save a brunette is doomed, but save a blond, and you''re a success. The Hitler worship is so extreme in the modern Bond movie writing that it''s impossible to deny it is there. 

And the directors are pathetic. Even given the ideal exotic locales, they manage to dumb down the scenery. One feels like the director actually says "How can we make this beautiful and exotic scenery look dull and depressing? Aha! I can do it!"

Of course the day will come when Craig will be the beneficiary of this fame and get to do actually good films for which he''ll be remembered. 

This movie is pretty much formula. The action is okay enough, and it isn''t as contrived to be depressing as Casino Royale or A View to a Kill, but it is depressing and dull.');

Dr. No is directed by Terence Young and co-adapted to screenplay by Richard Maibaum, Johanna Harwood & Berkely Mather from the novel of the same name written by Ian Fleming. It stars Sean Connery, Joseph Wiseman, Ursula Andress, Jack Lord & John Kitzmiller. Music is by Monty Norman and cinematography by Ted Moore.



And so it all began here, what was until Harry Potter arrived on the scene, the most successful film franchise in history. James Bond, a name that would become synonymous with suave spies, deranged villains, beautiful women, exotic locations, gadgets, cars and sex. Ian Fleming''s James Bond novels were big come the end of 1961, yet producers Cubby Broccoli and Harry Saltzman met some resistance from studios. It was never plain sailing, even after release the film garnered mixed reviews, but word of mouth and condemnation by the Vatican and the Kremlin propelled it to being one of the surprise hits of 62/63. At the box office it made £60 million Worldwide, this after being made on a budget of only £1 million.



Plot basically sees Connery''s Bond flying out to Jamaica to investigate the disappearance of agent Strangways (Timothy Moxon). Once there he finds a case of murder is to be investigated and evidence points to the mysterious Dr. No (Wiseman), who resides on Crab Quay island, a place feared by the superstitious locals. Bond must keep his wits about him as he gets closer to the truth, for there are many obstacles in his way and not everyone can be trusted. Cue the suave and athletic Mr. Bond getting involved with lovely ladies, dicing with death, making friends, making enemies and just generally being an all round awesome anti-hero.



SPECTRE: Special Executive for Counter-intelligence, Terrorism, Revenge and Extortion.



There are a number of changes from the book and some censor appeasement was required to get the film a certificate enabling youngsters to see the film with an adult. What Dr. No rounds out as is a jolly good spy/action movie yarn. Some of the hints are there for what would make Bond such a profitable and well loved franchise, but there''s no sign of the gadgetry, tricks and japes that would fill out so many of the titles that followed Dr. No. Here Bond is just armed with his Walter PPK 7.65MM pistol, Sunbeam Alpine car and his bravado and nouse.



Some future stalwart characters are given modest introductions (M, Felix Leiter, Moneypenny) and Ursula Andress sets the marker for all future Bond girls to follow. Ted Moore''s capturing of the Jamaica location is sumptuous, something that really comes to the fore on the re-mastered DVD edition of the film. Connery is supremely cool and fearless, the theme tune and gun barrel opening are already in place, and Terence Young, who directs three of the first four Bond movies, keeps it zippy and suspenseful when story gathers up a flame throwing tank, car chases, fights and a quite brilliant tarantula sequence.



Quite a debut, uneven at times as it begins to find its feet, but even if it wasn''t the first James Bond movie it would hold up as an entertaining bit of secret agent shenanigans regardless. 7.5/10');

After an MI6 chief & his secretary are murdered in Jamaica, agent 007 (Sean Connery) is sent to investigate. He teams-up with a boatman (John Kitzmiller) with focus on a mysterious nearby island owned by a shady German-Chinese mogul (Joseph Wiseman). Jack Lord is on hand as a CIA agent and Ursula Andress as a shell diver



Based on Ian Fleming’s 1958 novel, “Dr. No” (1962) was the beginning of the never-ending James Bond franchise and features the common staples: The catchy James Bond theme, the opening gun barrel sequence, the suave protagonist, gorgeous women, ritzy casino gambling, exotic locales, spy devices, action thrills, shaken-not-stirred drinks and a megalomaniac villain. 



While this one’s not as ridiculous with the gadgets or action as later installments, somehow Bond’s relatively mundane but increasingly dangerous investigation on Jamaica is compelling as it progresses to the lair of the titular antagonist. It’s no wonder that it was a hit and sparked the espionage hysteria of the ’60s.



Andress stands out on the feminine front, but there’s also Eunice Gayson as Sylvia Trench and Zena Marshall as Miss Taro, both just as beautiful in their own way.  



The film runs 1 hour, 49 minutes, and was shot in Jamaica and Pinewood Studios & London, England.

As far as I remember, this was the first Pedro Almodóvar film I saw, and it was up to my expectations. I heard that he was a very visual director, that he wasn''t afraid to show ugly things as they are, with realism and authenticity, and that he sometimes brought us complicated, ambitious stories. This movie is all of those. Honestly, even though it''s not a kind of cinema that I particularly like (and I don''t think I''m the only one who sometimes feels uncomfortable when realism and rawness are taken to the limit), I liked what I saw. However, there are several flaws, mainly in the story told. I''ll talk about that later.



To make this film, Almodóvar called a very competent cast of Spanish actors, and it is really necessary for us to recognize that Spanish cinema is going through a very good phase, with a lot of quality and very talented people. Although we are used to seeing him making American films, Antonio Banderas is Spanish, and it''s great to see him here, speaking in his mother tongue. He knows how to give his character a darkly restrained, cold, calculating and slightly psychotic look. Elena Anaya also leaves us with a very satisfactory work, even considering that she doesn''t have the material and time for more. Jan Cornet and Marisa Paredes, in a frankly secondary position, provide adequate support to their colleagues.



On a technical level, the film also has some interesting points. Filmed mostly in the Galician region, a short distance from Portugal, it is not a tourist postcard, we are barely able to recognize the locations (I didn''t). But this is secondary! The locations are good and well used, the sets are very good (especially the operating room, with all the medical apparatus and a very modern look) and the cinematography is really remarkable. Cleverly edited, it''s well paced and time passes without we''re noticing.



The screenplay is inspired by written material, but has been so overhauled by the director that it doesn''t have much connection with the original source. It''s something new, even if we can understand or guess where the inspiration for some details came from. We follow the saga of a surgeon, specializing in plastic and reconstructive surgery, to create synthetic skin that he can apply to burned or injured people. Of course, this stems from trauma – he lost his wife in a burning car, and more recently lost a daughter, who committed suicide. What happens is that, at a certain point, he starts to make increasingly morally questionable experiments, going so far as to kidnap a person. I don''t want to say too much, the film has many twists and turns that make the script more complicated than usual, but I won''t be being honest if I don''t say that there are many details and twists that have no logic at all. They simply do not make sense, starting with the creation of synthetic skin: the reconstruction of a burned face is a medical problem that is still far from being solved, but everyone knows that the skin is a human organ that regenerates itself, under the conditions and right time. It may never be the same as it was. And I can''t see how all of this is connected with any hypothetical sex change (I won''t say more, watch the film... but knowing that it''s a very grotesque story, so get the kids and grandparents out of the room).');

We, watching, are not the only people suspicious and as his fellow scientists become more openly sceptical, we begin to discover a little more of just what he''s been doing for all of these years and that''s the kind of plot twist that really does make you cross your legs!

"Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore is a significant improvement over its predecessors, proving that Steve Kloves really can work miracles - J. K. Rowling still has a lot to learn.



By completely shifting the main focus of the franchise to the love relationship between Albus Dumbledore and Gellert Grindelwald, as well as the exploration of the former''s imperfections and the tragic, complex past of his family, it gains an emotionally powerful, genuinely fascinating narrative component. Jude Law and Mads Mikkelsen''s superb performances broadly contribute to this.



Too bad the first half suffers from the constant tweaks to the saga, taking once-important characters through irrelevant side adventures and repairing plot points established in earlier installments, seriously undermining the previous films and negatively affecting the pacing of this one.

Then already in the first couple of scenes woke Disney goes full woke to cater for a very small but loudmouthed minority.

So, for me, this movie did get off to a poor start indeed.



Unfortunately the rest of the movie had literally nothing in it to remedy this bad start except for a bunch of special effects. I really do not understand what woke Disney thought when the put this franchise killer together.



The first movie, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, in the franchise was a great movie. It was colorful, it was family oriented and it was filled with magic and fantastic beasts. It was fun, it was humorous and it had a bit of adventure in it.



This movie is nothing like that. Why they call it Fantastic Beasts I do not understand. They should call it Boring Political Drama in the Potter Universe instead.



It is dark, grey and, mostly, boring. It is not really a family movie. A lot of the time not much is happening except people walking, standing or sitting and looking gloomy. There are some outbursts of magic action and these are really the only enjoyable scenes in the movie thanks to the special effects.

The film follows the same premise as the 1941 classic in that a baby elephant with giant ears is born into a travelling circus. Like in the animated film he is separated from his mother and soon becomes an unlikely circus act when it is discovered that his giant ears give him the power of flight. 

In the new version we are introduced to Holt Farrier (Colin Farrell); who returns from WWI injured and dealing with the fact that his wife has died  and he must raise their two children alone. Further complicating matters is the fact that Circus owner Max Medici (Danny DeVito), has sold the prized horses Holt used in his act in an effort to keep his struggling circus alive. 

What has become a tragedy soon becomes a boon when wealthy industrialist V.A. Vandevere (<ichael Keaton) offers to make Max a partner and take him and his troup on at his fabled entertainment park with Dumbo as his featured star. 

It is at this point where the film takes some wild deviations and becomes very linear with paper thin characters and an emphasis on effects over story. 

Director Tim Burton has once again crafted a film filled with lavish visuals as his take on the entertainment park and circus is amazing; but it as usual comes at a cost. Like most of Burton’s works, the visuals are the star and key element and the development of characters and story are often given little more than lip service. 

The same is true fro this film as we learn noting about the motivation of the characters and the villains play out as stock baddies without even a nod as to why they are so inclined to tehir action.s They are being evil just for the sake of being evil. The same can be said for the other characters as we are given very little reasons to care for them. There is a nice subplot with Eva Green but it is never fully developed and the worst part is that the title star almost becomes an afterthought in the final acts so we can be given scene after scene of lavinsh park visuals. 

The film may be a bit to dark and intense at times for younger viewers and those who remember the original may have a hard time with this take of the film. It entertains at times but could have been so much better.

Second review by Tracey Barrientos

In 1941 Walt Disney Pictures brought audiences around the world the fourth animated Disney feature film Dumbo. 78 years later Disney has partnered with Tim Burton to bring audiences of new generations a fresh and live action take on the classic tale.

After returning home and left injured from the war, Holt Farrier (Collin Farrell) unites with his kids and his beloved job and home. His home is a traveling circus and his act has been cut due to his injury. Max Medici (Danny DeVito) the owner of the circus asks him to forget about the act and instead take care of a newborn elephant with hopes that the young elephant would help the once booming but now looming circus. The peculiar pachyderm nicknamed Dumbo with extremely oversized ears is the new laughingstock of the circus until Holt’s children discover the magic within Dumbo. He can fly and is attracting attention from all around.

As a huge Tim Burton fan I was ecstatic to hear that he was set to direct the live action version of the beloved film. A fantastic cast was put together and to be honest I don’t know that anybody else could’ve played those roles as well as Collin Farrell, Michael Keaton, Danny DeVito, Eva Green and Alan Arkin just to name a few. They brought a sense of magic and true emotion to each character which added depth and soul to the film. Every time the first note from Danny Elfman’s music reaches my ear I instantly get goosebumps. I was extremely happy to here that familiar music in this film. As with all of Tim Burton’s films, it gave a touch of magic and intrigue that Dumbo deserved. The colors were beautiful and vibrant but still held drab contrast to what we are normally used to.

I was asked a little bit ago if the film made me cry. The answer is I did. Both with sad and happy tears. A film that encapsulates so many emotions in only two hours and leaves you with a happy heart, THAT is what I look for in a film. That is what a film should make an audience feel. A good tug at those heart strings along with happiness and laughter is the perfect formula. Well done Mr. Burton! I recommend this film to be seen by fans old and new because you won’t be disappointed.

1941’s Dumbo was never a favorite of mine. It’s a great movie with a sweet message (as most Disney flicks), but I was curious to see how a remake of a 60-min film would develop. Obviously, changes to the story not only will occur, but they need to. People have to stop desiring these live-action remakes to be a literal copy-paste of their originals and start being fair to these movies. Pure animation is different from live-action, and the latter provides a much more realistic environment than the former, so it’s evident that every remake they produce will have some “updates” in the more “silly” aspects.



Furthermore, I’ve witnessed a couple of “critics” hating this Dumbo. Hating! Calling it one of the worst films of the year! Now that’s a strong feeling to have against a movie that improves so much regarding its original. Yes, it has a bunch of narrative issues, and the dialogues can be cringe-worthy, but hating this 2019 remake while defending the original as it was some kind of masterpiece is ridiculous. Complaining about the 2019’s ending when the 1941’s is absolutely inadmissible is being a hypocrite. Whining about Dumbo not being 100% the star of the show when the original has the elephant discover his flight abilities four minutes before the end is dumb. In addition to that, this film runs for twice the original’s runtime! What did you expect?! That human characters wouldn’t be a necessary modification? 



Some “critics” are even complaining about animal abuse or their unnecessary exploration … Are they joking?! Have they seen the original? Do they remember how racist it was? How discrimination was treated as comedy? Even alcohol was handled as a plot point for God’s sake! 2019’s Dumbo barely has any animal violence, and its final message is against animal captivity or exploration, so any person who criticizes this ending is either a despicable human being or not a fan of the original Dumbo, at all.



Enough about those “critics”. I feel sick just remembering what they wrote/said. Unfortunately, 2019’s Dumbo does have a lot of screenplay issues. There’s no way of denying it. The human characters are filled with cliche storylines and child-written dialogues. I know that analyzing children’s acting is not exactly a fair critic, but I’ve seen so many remarkable young actors nowadays, who make Nico Parker and Finley Hobbins performances look not that good (their scripts also don’t help). The visual style characteristic of Tim Burton is definitely present, even if its magic becomes overwhelming at times. 1941’s Dumbo was very concentrated in one small location contrary to its 2019 remake where V. A. Vandevere‘s park feels like Disneyland.



The stiff dialogues don’t help the movie’s pacing, and its tone could be better balanced. Nevertheless, just the opportunity to watch such a gorgeous, magnificent, and visually jaw-dropping live-action elephant come to life is absolutely delightful and entertaining as hell. When a character like Dumbo makes you cry when he’s crying, makes you feel sad when he’s feeling sad, makes you happy when he’s feeling happy, that’s when you know the visual effects team has reached a point where live-action is pretty much reality. The little elephant looks like an adorable little elephant. I mean, what better compliment can I give a live-action character than “it looks and feels real”?



Even with the issues mentioned above, it’s still a heartfelt story, filled with emotional moments, and a wonderful message. Technically, it might lack consistency and some overall quality, but I end up enjoying myself. Experiencing Dumbo‘s pain, happiness, and his bond with the kids flourish is special. Colin Farrell and Eva Green deliver good performances, and their character arcs, cliche as they may be, still carry some efficiency. There’s a wrong vibe surrounding the word “cliche”, like it’s a bad thing. Not at all! Something being cliche just means we’ve seen that before a lot of times, it doesn’t mean we’ve seen it performed better or worse. Dumbo is a remake of a very influential 1941 film, so obviously, cliches are a certainty. It’s a Disney tale, after all. 



In the end, cliche as it might be, 2019’s Dumbo improves on a lot of aspects of its predecessor. I do believe these movies are almost incomparable since the dimension, runtime, and even the main plot are surprisingly (or not) different. Still, not remembering or even acknowledging the original not only is an absolute flaw, but it can ultimately make you a hypocrite, so be careful with what you write/say. I understand a person not enjoying this film or not liking it as much as I did, but if you hate (!) it, you better give me good enough reasons.



Dumbo is probably the most visually stunning and incredibly realistic live-action character Disney was able to produce so far. This little elephant alone is worth the price of admission. His arc is way bigger and complex than the one in the original, which can either delight or disappoint you. To me, it not only worked, but it finished strong and way better than the original. It’s upsetting that the screenplay couldn’t accompany Burton‘s impressive visual style, even if overwhelming at times, as well as the human characters who feel a bit detached from the actual story to tell. It’s still a good time at the movie theater, so go see it!

2019''s <em>''Dumbo''</em> surpasses the ''41 film with ease, it''s admittedly a low bar. There''s actually a storyline to this one which is pleasing, while the live-action nature really helps suck me into believing in the - obviously ludicrous - plot. With that noted, it isn''t perfect. The pacing is off, while the antagonists are a bit irritating - if suitably cast.



As for the protagonist, Colin Farrell plays his role nicely. Danny DeVito is an obvious but excellent cast for Max Medici, while Michael Keaton and Eva Green suit their roles. Amusing cameo from Michael Buffer too, by the way. As for the kid actors, not great... There is no real human appearance in the first film, so this one had to create one from scratch and I think they did a good job.



Dumbo is super cute, just as before, and his story is undoubtedly hearty; which are arguably the only things that the 40s film did right.



Overall, I liked this remake.');

After WW1, a struggling American circus discovers they have a star attraction on hand, a big-eared baby elephant that can fly! Colin Farrell plays the one-armed elephant trainer, Danny DeVito the circus owner, Michael Keaton a Walt Disney-like entrepreneur and Eva Green his French performer.  



“Dumbo” (2019) is a live-action remake of the 1941 classic and almost twice as long. Being made by Tim Burton, it LOOKS great and you can’t beat the cast (except for the monotone kids). Unfortunately the story is generally dull. One can’t help but think of the excellent “Water for Elephants” (2011), but this is nowhere near the same league. The flat script by Ehren Kruger needed reworked for more human interest and pizazz. It plays it too safe.



It’s strange that a Disney film would feature a Walt Disney-like character (with ‘Dreamland’ standing in for Disneyland), but put a malevolent spin on him. Meanwhile the sharp Green is serviceable as the aerial performer who works with Dumbo, but she seemed to be a tad long-in-the-tooth for the role at 38 during shooting.



As a fan of the underrated “Dark Shadows” (2012) I thought I’d like this despite the bad reviews and mediocre box office performance. Wrong. It’s okay, but that’s not good enough for a live-action remake of such an iconic flick.



The film runs 1 hour, 57 minutes, and was shot in Cardington, Bedfordshire, England, and Pinewood Studios, which is about an hour south in the west London area.

In 1941, Disney debuted one of its most outstanding feature films and the shortest. Relatively cheap to produce and without great ambitions, the film was a success and even the US entry into World War II did not turn away the public, who saw the film as a welcome escape. It would also be the first Disney film to be released on VHS and is now considered an important part of the history of animated cinema, and of universal cultural memory. Making a live-action with enough dignity to match the original was, therefore, a very demanding task in itself. I cannot say that the result fully achieved the objectives, but the truth is that I liked what I saw.



Unlike the original film, which focuses on how Dumbo overcame being different from the others, this film passes very briefly on that subject, almost never addresses the issue of difference, and chooses to focus on what happens next, on how the circus deals with unexpected success, and in Dumbo''s relationship with his mother and the human elements that surround him. There are some predictable sub-plots here, such as the drama of the Farrier family, grappling with the death of their mother and the return of their father, injured, from the war, or the difficulties of a small circus with financial problems to compete with other entertainments. However, the movie seems to get darker and more adult as we watch it, and the truth is that I would have some doubts about letting young children see this movie.



The main human role in the film is played by the experienced Colin Farrell, who offers us a good job, full of commitment, but unable to resist when he has to share the scene with Danny DeVito, a very charismatic actor who feels completely comfortable in his role, shinning in a very particular way here. Eva Green also deserves an applause for her work here, in yet another character that is somewhat peculiar, but full of elegance. Unfortunately, the rest of the cast is considerably less interesting and works less well: Michael Keaton is a predictable and uninteresting villain, more contrived than menacing; Alan Arkin doesn''t have more than a cameo with a few lines of spoken text; Nico Parker and Finley Hobbins don''t do more than what''s asked of them, and that''s not enough.



Directed by Tim Burton, the film was destined from the start to be a massive work of high-quality visual effects and CGI. Burton likes that, all his films have a lot of visual elements and the visual aesthetic, sometimes a bit far-fetched and kitschy, is one of the style marks of this director, who in this film seems to want to capture the most of the magic of life in the circus, alongside the difficulties and hardships that its artists know. Thanks to the budget available, this director had access to the best CGI and there is virtually not a shred of reality in the film: everything was filmed in the studio, using green screens and other similar resources. Dumbo is all done in computer, and results in a harmonious union between the expressiveness seen in the original animation and the naturalness and realism that we can achieve through CGI.



And if visually the film is extraordinary and really well executed, the rest is not far behind in quality. There are scenes that are virtually copied from the original film, and some of the most famous songs will also reappear ("Baby Mine", "Pink Elephants on Parade", etc.), in clear homages to the first film. The original soundtrack made for this film, signed by Danny Elfman, is very good and does an excellent job.');

The animated film introduced audiences to memorable characters like Timothy Mouse, Mrs. Jumbo, and the crows, creating a timeless classic that resonated with viewers for generations.



In the 2019 live-action adaptation, the essence of the original characters was retained while introducing a new twist with a circus theme and a focus on family dynamics. The film successfully brought the magic of the animated classic to life in a new way, appealing to audiences both familiar with the original and newcomers to the story.



The well-written scripts of both the animated and live-action versions added credibility to the films and continued the legacy of the beloved tale of Dumbo. Audiences found enjoyment in both adaptations, appreciating the care taken to honor the source material while also bringing a fresh perspective to the narrative.



However, criticism arose regarding the portrayal of the crows in the original animated movie, with some labeling them as racist stereotypes. This controversy led to calls for the cancellation of the film, which sparked discussions around the historical context of the characters and their depiction in the story. It is noted that understanding the historical significance of such characters is crucial, and dismissing them as racist without context can lead to misinterpretations and perpetuate harmful stereotypes.



In conclusion, both the original animated "Dumbo" and its live-action remake are celebrated for their storytelling, character development, and ability to enchant audiences. While controversies surrounding certain characters highlight the need for nuanced discussions on representation and historical context, these adaptations continue to hold a special place in the hearts of fans and showcase the enduring magic of Dumbo''s tale.');

Thunderball is directed by Terence Young and adapted to screenplay by Richard Maibaum and John Hopkins from a story by Kevin McClory, Jack Whittingham and Ian Fleming. It stars Sean Connery, Adolfo Celi, Claudine Auger, Rick Van Nutter and Martine Beswick. Music is scored by John Barry and cinematography by Ted Moore.



The fourth outing for James Bond (Connery) sees 007 assigned to the Bahamas to try and thwart SPECTRE''s number 2 operative, Emilio Largo (Celi). Largo has hijacked two atomic bombs from NATO and sets about extorting huge ransoms of money. If his terms are not met he will blow up major cities.



It was meant to be the first James Bond film, but Thunderball became part of a long drawn out legal battle between Kevin McClory, Jack Whittingham and Ian Fleming. Eventually an out of court settlement was reached and Thunderball rolled into theatres in 1965. After the colossal success of Goldfinger, and Bond as a pop culture phenomenon, producers Albert Broccoli & Harry Saltzman knew that they had to try and up the ante to keep Bond on top. They were also acutely aware that many imitators were springing up on film and TV. These facts led Bond to go epic, with the producers going for a more is more approach, however, Thunderball is a considerable step down from Goldfinger.



As with many other Bond movies, Thunderball polarises opinions amongst the fans. Some are happy to laud the pure entertainment value on offer, the reliance on hardware and gadgets viewed as an aid to the Bond persona and not a hindrance to his humanistic worth. Technically the film is often exceptional, be it on or under the water, director Young really crafts some Bondian quality. The exotic Bahamas locale is beautifully realised by Ted Moore, Barry''s blunderbuss score is one of his best for a Bond movie and Connery has charisma in abundance. The girls, too, are delightful, particularly Auger who positively sizzles with sexuality. Bond''s by play with M, Q and Felix Leiter (Nutter very enjoyable and more charismatic than Cec Linder in Goldfinger) is well scripted and performed. While for those who adore the gadgets and daring stunts? Thunderball excels with its assortment of trick vehicles, under water weaponry, aids and radioactive pills! Without doubt the near $6 million budget is all up there on the screen.



Yet for other fans, and this is the category I fall into, it''s a film of too many flaws to be considered one of the greats. Whilst it''s undeniable that when it hits the high points it excites royally (the extended underwater battle is eye popping brilliance), but there''s too many languid passages in the overlong running time. Young himself lamented that he couldn''t get the pace right on account of the plot structure. The other major problem for me is Celi as Largo. Visually he''s striking, with his white hair and eye patch, he looks well villainous, but physically he''s wrong and someone you can''t buy into as a man able to not only take on Bond, but to overcome him as well! While the finale lacks a grandness to reward those having sat for over 2 hours with the film. But what do I know? Film made a stunning $141 million at the box office! And the fanaticism that began with Goldfinger had now reached epic proportions.



The more is more approach worked for the makers, and it ensured that for the time being Bond was going to stay in this epic, gadget effects strewn groove. Connery wasn''t happy though, he had voiced his concerns about Bond becoming characterless, while he hated the mania surrounding the films and his role within them. He would return for the next instalment, You Only Live Twice, but the question was, would it be his last performance as Bond? 7/10');

The female characters become more than merely ornamental and more interesting, the plots become more intricate, the villains less stereotypical, and the special effects better and better.



Having said all that, I must confess I give Thunderball a pass on any such criticism or comparison, for a rather odd and personal reason, and not just because I like Sean Connery! As a teenager I sort of inherited the soundtrack album for Thunderball, either from my dad or an older brother. That was well before I ever saw the movie. Except for the Tom Jones title song, the album is all instrumental, and I found myself playing the album while doing school work, or reading, or writing short stories and later on, novels. I am surprised I didn''t wear the grooves out. Later my taste moved towards instrumental new age and finally on to ambient music. 



Where was I? Oh yeah, so when I finally watched Thunderball, I recognized the background music whenever it came into play. So I liked this film in a way I never quite experienced with other James Bond films. I admit I don’t know that this helps prospective viewers, so I will add that if the newer Bond films seem to glossy and too much like each other for your taste, Thunderball is a slightly different animal, so you might enjoy it.

After a couple atomic bombs are stolen from the RAF, agent 007 (Sean Connery) travels to Nassau, Bahamas, to clash with SPECTRE agent Emil Largo (Adolfo Celi) and his femme fatale accomplice (Luciana Paluzzi). Claudine Auger is on hand as Largo’s naïve woman.  



"Thunderball" (1965) is one of my favorites of Connery’s run in the franchise due to the interesting intrigue, the Tom Jones’-sung title song, and the best cast of women in the series. Other than Luciana Paluzzi (Fiona) and Claudine Auger (Domino), Molly Peters plays a voluptuous masseuse at a health clinic while statuesque Martine Beswick is on hand as an MI6 agent in the Bahamas (Beswick previously appeared in “From Russia with Love” as one of the Gypsy cat-fighters). 



I was surprised that the bulk of the flick takes place in the Bahamas as “Dr. No” (1962) took place mostly in Jamaica, which is 400 miles south in the Caribbean.



For those interested, “Thunderball” was remade as the non-canon “Never Say Never Again” (1983), which was Connery’s final excursion as 007. I prefer this one, which was the most successful Bond flick of the 60s (at the box office), but “Never Say Never Again” is worth checking out even though it’s not as ambitious as Roger Moore’s dynamic “Octopussy,” released the same year.  



The film runs 2 hour, 10 minutes and was shot in Château d''Anet, Anet (opening) & Paris, France; England; and the Bahamas.

All the 60s charm and camp permeate every aspect of the film, creating a ton of classic goofy charm (and a few awkward comments that aren’t very politically correct nowadays).

After this we enter the era of Silly 007, with a layover for Lazenby who walked the line and ended up more Cannery than Moore. And as where the Silly Bonds do still have their appeal (and trust me, I still love them) the franchise never seemed as lethal or as cool again.

It''s upsetting for Bond fans that Eon productions ran away from the lively, fun formula that sustained the franchise for 40 years. What does it leave us with? Well - this type of Bond film unfortunately. Staggeringly bland and uninteresting.  If we removed the name Bond from the film we would have no idea that we were watching a Bond movie. 



It is depressing that they flushed 40 years of fun Bond films down the toilet to satiate people who dislike classic Bond adventures. They reached for a wider audience by going all generic action film to the detriment of the Bond legacy.



Who is this unsophisticated, short, blond man in the suit? Unfortunately, _he could be anyone_ - even you or I. Bond is now a lager chugging everyman. Ian Fleming would be furious.



No chance of Craig''s Bond wearing  _a strap on plastic seagull hat_ as Connery did in the classic Goldfinger (1964) - they would not dare make the films that fun and entertaining anymore.

Quantum of Solace is directed by Marc Forster and written by Paul Haggis, Neil Purvis and Robert Wade, suggested from the stories written by Ian Fleming. It stars Daniel Craig, Olga Kurylenko, Mathieu Amalric, Judi Dench, Giancarlo Giannini, Gemma Arteton & Jeffrey Wright. It is the 22nd film of the James Bond series.



Following on straight from Casino Royale, we find James Bond thirsting for revenge on those he believes responsible for Vesper Lynd''s death.



Is Quantum Of Solace a great action film? Yes it surely is, is it however a great James Bond picture? Not quite, apparently, given the often venomous reaction to it from some Bond fan quarters. You wonder if Quantum Of Solace is a victim of Casino Royale''s soaring success? A film that even surprised the many Daniel Craig haters. Were these internet warriors preying for a bad Bond film purely to further their argument that Craig should not be Bond? Did QOS give them smug satisfaction? Actually no it didn''t, the box office and longevity of professional critiques proves this fact. Further viewings of QOS show it to be very astute in the Bond universe, where much of the charges of it not being fun enough etc just do not stick. As for not being Bondian enough? Opening car chase, a pursuit on foot that ends in a quite exhilarating rope dangle punch up, speedboat chaos, aeroplane peril with free-falling! Not Bond enough? Seriously? While it''s also great to see Bond active on a motorcycle again.



The Casino Royale rebooted and re-suited offering was popular because it had an earthy make over, Daniel Craig''s Bond is a fallible human being brimming with egotistical ruggedness. It''s much of the same here in Quantum, where he is forced to go rouge, something that again has proved to be an itchy narrative thrust with sections of the Bond faithful. Yet as serious as he is, driven by pangs of annoyance, revenge and unanswered questions, Bond does have time to lay out a quip, there is some fun stuff their, honestly, Mother. Personally I enjoy the dark half of this Bond, "I don''t have any friends", he wouldn''t care", and "how many is that now?", these are moments nearly as good as the interwoven opera blood bath and Bond drinking away his demons with 6 high velocity cocktails. Then there is Craig. Ah, Craig, Daniel Craig, again perfect in the tux and kicking arse with streetwise credibility, each scar on his nicely formed body a testament to this new rugged Bond of the people. That he rises above a relatively muddling script is testament to not only his acting ability, but also his new found acceptance in this most iconic of cinematic roles amongst the British institution that is James Bond.



The rest of the cast are a mixed bunch, Jeffrey Wright & Giancarlo Giannini are again merely making up the numbers, though the last gets to give Bond one of the film''s darkest and cold inducing moments. Judi Dench of course does her usual solid M performance, swearing and growing the balls she hinted at previously, while Olga Kurylenko is very much a sparky Bond girl to savour; even if the sub-plot involving her almost feels like it was shoe-horned into the script as an added extra. Elsewhere there are problems. Casino Royale, had on the surface a weak villain, a man merely playing cards to pay off a more evil source, but he was effective. Sadly here in the Quantam universe the main villain is a hindrance to the picture. Mathieu Amalric''s Dominic Greene does a good line in smarmy, but he''s so weak the film nearly crumbles under the weight of his banality. The people at the house of Bond need to realise that little fish villains are only OK if we get the big daddy shark showing his/her face later in proceedings, for if this trend continues I fear the franchise could well lose the edge so well built up in Royale, and Gemma Arteton is pretty, but pretty ineffective. The locations are sumptuous, mind, and the sets are Bondian delights, with the title sequence certainly hitting the spot in spite of the quite dreadful Jack Black and Alcia Keys'' theme song that accompanies the sequence. A homage to a former great Bond film sequence is respectful but a touch lazy, but QOS still overcomes its failings to be up above many action pictures of the last decade; this in spite of it being very slim line at an hour and 45 in length. Crucially, though, it pulses with Bond aggression and egotistical nous, just as Fleming wanted it. But this only comes out with further viewings...



Skyfall will be the next venture for Bond, regardless of quality we know that it will fail to appease every Bond fan on the planet. That''s just the way it is with the series, so many want so many different things from their Bond. But I feel this is a good period for Bond, they do have the right man wearing the tux and as a character he is well tuned into the times, both politically and cinematically, it''s now up to the makers to fuse the two and deliver a film to fully realise the rebooted franchise''s potential and maybe, just maybe, win the dissenters'' trust. 7/10');

Quantum of Solace starts 20 minutes after the events of Casino Royale with a fast edited but choppy car chase sequence. This is the first hint that Bond is following the Bourne films as co-editor Richard Pearson previously edited one of the Bourne films. This also highlights director''s Marc Forster inexperience in making action films as many of the action sequences are hard to follow because of the way it has been edited.



The film was also hampered by the 2008 writer''s strike. This meant that film went into production without a full working script which also meant that the director and even Daniel Craig allegedly wrote scenes for the film. It might explain the short running time.



The film unveils Quantum as a shady organisation with tentacles everywhere even in the heart of the British security services. The setting in Bolivia with disputes about water gives the film a political edge with a cynical look at corporations making dicey alliances with dictatorships to mutually exploit the people and plunder resources.



Forster gives the film some intriguing set pieces such the opera scene which is the meeting point for Quantum operatives which Bond infiltrates.

Bond seeks justice for the death of his woman in the previous film as well as those responsible for an assassination attempt on M (Judi Dench). The trail leads from mountainous northern Italy to the rooftops of Siena, Italy, to London to Haiti and finally to the secluded desert of Bolivia and Dominic Greene (Mathieu Amalric), a world-renowned developer of green technology. Greene is intent on securing a barren area of Bolivia in exchange for assisting General Medrano stage a coup there (Joaquín Cosio). Since the CIA looks the other way, only 007 stands in Greene''s way with assistance from a retired spy and two formidable beauties (Olga Kurylenko and Gemma Arterton). M wonders if she can trust Bond or if his need for vengeance has corrupted him.



Released in 2008, "Quantum of Solace" is the second of five Bond films with Daniel Craig as Agent 007. Craig makes for a unique James Bond and I appreciate the serious vibe of his installments.



The problem with "Quantum of Solace," the 23nd Bond film (if you count 1983''s non-Eon "Never Say Never Again"), is the rapid-fire editing during the action scenes. Take, for instance, the opening chase-sequence that takes place on the tollway that leads through mountain tunnels from Nice through Monte Carlo and down to Portofino in Italy. It''s a spectacularly scenic area. Unfortunately you won''t see much of it here, just quick flashes; more importantly, you''ll hardly understand what''s going on due to the moronic fast editing. The camera switches about 3 or 4 times per second! I''m sure the filmmakers think such quick angle changes convey energy, but when it''s done this fast all it does is confuse, disorient and ANNOY the viewer. It wouldn''t be so bad if this was the only sequence like this but, no, after Bond''s initial meeting with M (Judi Dench) there''s another ridiculous rapid-fire action scene.



The filmmakers need to get a grip that James Bond is not a mindless action hero. He''s too smart for that; he''s the ultimate ''cool'' attitude. Violence for him is an irritation resorted to only when necessary. He exists for the mental play, the checkmate and, later, the martini, shaken, not stirred; the beautiful woman too, of course. The only way the average viewer can successfully make it past the 25-minute mark of "Quantum of Solace" and enjoy the movie is if s/he drinks a pot of heavily-caffeinated coffee beforehand. If you do this it''s an entertaining Bond picture with some effective sequences, like when Bond and Camille find themselves stuck in the remote desert after surviving a thrilling aerial combat, plus Olga (Camille) and Gemma (Strawberry Fields) are top-of-the-line, but the annoying quick-editing in the action scenes heavily mars the flick and prevents it from being in the top tier of the franchise.



The film runs 1 hour, 46 minutes, and was shot in England, Italy, Austria, Spain, Panama (standing in for Haiti), Chili (the Atacama Desert) and Baja California (the last two standing in for Bolivia).

Pretty quickly, "007" is on the trail of the ostensibly benign millionaire "Greene" (Mathieu Amalric) and as the escapades gather pace we realise that the industrialist has a cunning plan to manipulate a crime consortium of global proportions; to take over the government of Bolivia and to control the ebb and flow of one of that nation''s most crucial resources. Thing is, though, that this is all just too weak. The story is just lacklustre and undercooked. The efforts of the baddies - Amalric, Anatole Taubman as henchman "Elvis" and a straight-from-central-casting Joaquín Cosio as the scheming "Gen. Medrano" just to don''t create any sense of menace or peril. Far too much time is spent swinging from scaffolding, or trashing a rather impressive set for a performance of "Tosca" rather than creating a solid story with twists and turns. Again, the character of "M" (Dame Judi Dench) has much more of a role, and sacrilegious as it may be, she just isn''t very good at it. She seemed to be wearing the same clothes for most of her scenes, too! The dialogue is rather dry, no fun innuendo or double-entendre and though quite spunky, Olga Kurylenko is no natural as "Camille", a girl with an axe to grind (ideally into the general''s skull). It ends a bit like "Licence to Kill" (1989) and, indeed, is all just a bit too much of an hybrid of the other films to offer much by way of distinction.

Many find Quantum of Solace a disappointing entry in the Daniel Craig Bond era, but I beg to differ. When viewed as a stand-alone film, I can understand frustrations with a meager storyline. But when considered the conclusion of Casino Royale, this movie becomes much better. Casino Royale ends with Bond suffering a significant loss, and Quantum allows him to take revenge. Bond is still grappling with a broken heart and is less interested in the standard Bond romantic escapades than usual. In fact, the main Bond girl of the movie is more of a partner in the film than a romantic prospect. The opening fight sequence, the action, the stunts, and the locations are some of the franchise''s best. The expectations following Casino Royale were so high that Quantum of Solace never stood a chance (much like Spectre following Skyfall), but when Quantum is coupled with Casino Royale, more depth and development are added to both films.');

So my plan is to watch the Bond movies in order from the first Bond movie to the last bond. I''m currently on “On Her Majesty''s Secret Service”. One of the main things I noticed from Her Majesty''s Secret Service is the fact that the new Bond doesn''t seem to be as sexually assaulting as the previous bond ( Sean Connery). It did seem like the first Bond would like to force himself upon women which seemed a bit off, and was really off putting. For most of the previous Bond films this new Bond didn''t seem as bad, but there was still a lot of this bond having his way with the women he wanted to have his way with. which I''m still not in total agreement with. 



I think the biggest problem I have with most of the Bond movies is really  that they all follow a very very specific formula. the formula itself seems to always be James Bond shows it up at some place. He assumes a new identity. He then starts snooping around. He finds the villain, has contact with the villain. The villain finds out who he is. They then put him in a room or put him in some place that easily escapable. Miraculously, James Bond figures out a way to get out of said room which no one decided to guard and no one decided to put any additional reinforcements on. specifically they put him in a room for the gondola cables. If I was a super villain I wouldn''t put somebody in the room which houses the gears which are kind of the only way to get up to said Superfortress.

Well the movie is an overall bad. it''s starting to really feel like I''m watching the same movie over and over again. which, if you like this same movie over and over again I could see how you would like this movie. However, I don''t really like watching this same movie over and over and over again.');

On Her Majesty''s Secret Service is directed by Peter Hunt and adapted to screenplay by Richard Maibaum from the novel written by Ian Fleming. It stars George Lazenby, Diana Rigg, Telly Savalas, Ilse Steppat, Yuri Borienko and Gabriele Ferzetti. Music is by John Barry and cinematography by Michael Reed.



Bond 6 and 007 is obsessed with locating SPECTRE supremo Ernst Stavro Blofeld. After rescuing beautiful Countess Tracy di Vincenzo from suicide, this brings Bond into contact with her father, Marc Ange Draco, who agrees to help Bond find Blofeld in exchange for 007 courting Tracy. Blofeld is located in the Switzerland Alps at Piz Gloria, where he is masterminding a fiendish plot involving biological extinction of food group species''. Bond will need to use all his wits to stop the plan from being executed, he also has big matters of the heart to contend to as well...



Connery gone, but not for good as it turned out, so into the tuxedo came George Lazenby, an Australian model with no previous acting experience of note. It would be Lazenby''s only stint as 007, badly advised by those around him that Bond had no future in the upcoming 70s, his head swelling with ego by the day (something he readily admits and regrets), Lazenby announced he would only be doing the one James Bond film. The legacy of OHMSS is the most interesting in the whole Bond franchise, for where once it was reviled and wrongly accused of being a flop, it now, over 40 years later, is regarded as being one of the finest entries in the whole series. Yes it is still divisive, I have seen some fearful arguments about its worth, but generations of critics and film makers have come along to laud it as essential Bond and essential Fleming''s Bond at that.



Everything about OHMSS is different to what Connery''s Bond had become, the gadgets are gone and heaven forbid, Bond got a heart and fell in love. He was a man, with real aggression, real emotions and forced to use brain and brawn instead of mechanical trickery. Changes in the production department, too, wasn''t just about Lazenby''s appearance. Peter Hunt, previously the Bond film''s editor, directed his one and only Bond film, and Michael Reed on cinematography also appears for the one and only time. New Bond, new era, but reviews were mixed and in spite of making a profit of over $73 million Worldwide, this was considerably down on previous films. The reviews didn''t help, with much scorn poured on Lazenby for not being Connery, but really it''s hard to imagine anyone coming in and not getting beat with that particular stick! Box office take wasn''t helped by the film''s length, at over 2 hours 10 minutes, this restricted the number of showings in theatres, something that should be greatly noted.



Away from Bond anyway, OHMSS is a stunning action thriller in its own right. From the opening beach side fist fight, where uppercuts lift men off their feet and drop kicks propel them backwards, to helicopter attacks, bobsleigh pursuits (resplendent with punches and flinging bodies), ski chases and a car chase in the middle of a stock car race: on ice! There''s enough pulse pumping action here to fill out two Bond movies. But the Bond aspects are magnificent as well. Lazenby has wonderful physicality and throws a mean punch, he cuts a fine figure of a man and he''s acting inexperience isn''t a problem in the hands of the astute Hunt. Lazenby is matched by Rigg as Tracy, the best Bond girl of them all, she''s no bimbo, she''s tough (fighting off a guy with a broken bottle), smart yet vulnerable, funny and heart achingly beautiful, her interplay with Lazenby is brilliantly executed, so much so that when the devastating finale arrives it has extra poignancy. A scene that closes the film on a downbeat note and remains the most emotional scene ever put into a Bond movie.



Savalas finally gives us a villain who can compete with Bond on a physical level, making the fight between them an evenly matched and believable one. He lacks Pleasance''s sinister fizzog, though the bald pate and Grecian looks marks Savalas out as an imposing foe as well. The Swiss Alps setting is gorgeous, with Reed capturing the scope magnificently, while some of his colour lensing in the interiors soothe the eyes considerably. Barry''s score is one of his best, lush romantic strains accompany Tracy and James, operatic overtures dart in and out of the Swiss scenery and the James Bond theme is deftly woven into the action sequences. Louis Armstrong''s beautiful "We Have All The Time In The World" features prominently, perfectly romantic and forever to be thought of as part of the Bond Universe. Finally it''s the great writing that gives us the best sequence involving the trifecta of Bond, Moneypenny (Lois Maxwell) and M (Bernard Lee). 5 minutes of class that gives Moneypenny an acknowledged importance in the relationship between the two men in her life. It''s just one of a number of truly excellent scenes in the greatest Bond film of them all. 10/10');

Agent 007 falls for a mob boss''s daughter (Diana Rigg) and investigates a Swiss mountain-top lair where Blofeld (Telly Savalas) schemes to brainwash an assortment of women from around the world for his nefarious purposes.



"On Her Majesty''s Secret Service" (1969) was the sixth James Bond film and the first without Sean Connery in the starring role. Australian George Lazenby took over the part for this ONE AND ONLY time.



Many Bond fans point out that this picture is the most faithful to Ian Fleming''s character and book series. The story is taken from the novel of the same name.



People usually have two problems with this episode in the Bond series: (1) Lazenby as Bond and (2) After the first 20 minutes the story lacks any real action for the next hour or so wherein Bond goes undercover to investigate Blofeld''s lair.



Concerning the second issue: Because the story involves at least one full hour (probably longer) of action-less spy investigation, those with ADD probably won''t like this film. Personally, I enjoyed it; I can''t stand when films have an explosion every two minutes to supposedly keep things "happening" and maintain the interest of the audience. Bond masquerading as Sir Hillary at the "allergy clinic" is both interesting and amusing. Besides, the last 40 minutes or so feature numerous thrilling action sequences: ski chases, a car chase, a bobsled chase and the final assault on Blofeld''s mountain stronghold.



Needless to say, if you''re a fan of winter sports, you''ll want to see this film. By the way, George Lazenby was a very accomplished skier and had won two contests in Australia before taking on the role of Bond at the age of 29, the youngest Bond as of this writing.



Speaking of Lazenby as 007, he looks and acts like James Bond to me. Maybe he doesn''t have the same charismatic flare as Connery in the 60s (Who does?), but he certainly has his own unique appeal.



Lazenby, incidentally, was a martial arts expert, which he taught during his stint in the Australian army. He even studied under Bruce Lee and later stated that it was Lee''s philosophical teachings that enabled him to go on to have such a successful business career and personal life. In fact, George was actually going to have dinner with Bruce the night he died (!) and even replaced him in what was supposed to be Lee''s next film "The Shrine of Ultimate Bliss" (1974).



He amusingly commented on Pierce Brosnan as the new Bond in 1995''s "Goldeneye": "... this is the 90s and women want a different man, a man who shows his feminine side. Pierce definitely has that." He also reflected on the character of Bond himself: "He''s a ruthless bastard, really."



As for the women in this movie, Diana Rigg is undeniably good-looking but she doesn''t do anything for me personally (too tall and thin), but there are numerous other beauties to behold throughout the picture.



Because of Lazenby and the film''s literary faithfulness, this is a very unique and worthwhile Bond adventure. It''s also a must for those who love winter sports and spectacular Swiss winter locales.



It is the longest Bond film at 2 hours, 22 minutes, up until Daniel Craig era; and was filmed in Portugal, Switzerland and Pinewood Studios, England.

On Her Majesty’s Secret Service doesn’t tend to get the same love as many of the older Bond films, and that’s a shame because it boasts some significant firsts for the Bond franchise, some striking set pieces, and bold choices. Some of the friction faced by OHMSS is due to this being the first time James Bond was officially played by someone other than Sean Connery. George Lazenby played the part well but did little to make the character his own other than maybe being a little cheesier. But that wasn’t the only first in this film. James Bond fell in love and got married for the first time, broke the fourth wall for the first time, and faced a villain who escaped him from a previous film for the first time. OHMSS broke a lot of ground and had one of the best climactic finale battles of the early Bond films. And to top it all off, it’s technically a Christmas movie!');

It was also made in 1969 and I hate having to press the spoilers button... so the review is going to be hard and... really? It came out in 69, everyone had a chance to see it already... but whatever.



Lazenby, had he continued, could have carried on the Connery Era Bond into the 70s. He still had a few Moore Era tropes, a joke or two that was clearly very Roger Moore, but his delivery, his persona, his very being were far more Connery and the cold blooded assassin would have continued, with only a momentary glimpse of heart that, we know, hardened him in some ways.



It certainly sets a gold standard among 007 films and lays out some VERY important background that disproves the new "James Bond is only a title and not one person" argument that some people are making in order to rewrite the character entirely. Background that is revisited in Dalton''s Era, thus cementing 007 as one person.



Connery is not 007 anymore (and they address it in a 4th wall breaking joke from the start) but his persona lives on in OHMSS. This is probably the last of the Classic Connery Era Bonds, discounted because Lazenby is in the title role. But the mood, the character, they are all still there.

It has nothing to do with Lazenby being Bond. It''s just that it was written to be just a depressing piece of trash for the Hollywood formula of the late sixties than went into the eighties.

There is little scenery, little action, little to see of the bad guys. Bond is pretty much on his own in a "spy movie" instead of a "Bond movie". Bond is in a complex in a mountain surrounded by snow. If this wasn''t the lowest budget ever for a Bond movie, someone was robbed.

It is written with "hate", which was the standard of the late sixties through the eighties. 

As someone born in 1956, this was about all I was exposed to in art, film, TV, theater, religion, everywhere.

It was the Hollywood formula, and to see anything else, you literally had to sneak off while everyone else was asleep and see something "not depressing" on your own.

If you have seen sufficient films in your life, then you would also find it nothing special. This a found-footage kind where a student making a thesis on an old woman with alzheimer. As usual, something goes wrong and all hell breaks loose. So finding the root cause and stopping it becomes the main task for all who are involved with it.



I am sure those who watch films rarely might have more fun with it. I mean edgy moments with all the scares. From a new director with a decent cast. This is another title from the recent that to have a name Logan. Like all the horrors, this too ended with wide open, but so far there''s no news about a sequel. I hope they won''t make it.

A mission in wintery Siberia leads Agent 007 (Roger Moore) to globetrot from England to Paris to San Francisco and Silicon Valley investigating a horse-racing scam and the psychopathic entrepreneur, Max Zorin (Christopher Walken), who schemes to flood Silicon Valley for the purpose of creating a global microchip monopoly.



This was Moore’s last of 7 Bond films from 1973-1985 and it’s a solid Bond flick, just not up to the exceptionalness of the previous four films: “The Spy Who Loved Me” (1977), “Moonraker” (1979), “For Your Eyes Only” (1981) and “Octopussy” (1983). Just as “For Your Eyes Only” toned down the excesses of “Moonraker,” so “A View to a Kill” (1985) scales things down after the ultra-action-packed adventures of “Octopussy.”



As such, the movie focuses a little more on the psychological drama of intrigue and rivalry. For instance, there’s a long sequence at Zorin’s impressive chateau and a horse racing scene that’s reminiscent of the low-key golf game in “Goldfinger” (1964). Despite this direction, there’s still a lot of action, like a thrilling ski chase in Siberia, a murder/chase at the Eiffel Tower & Paris, a brouhaha at a mansion, a fiery elevator shaft episode, a wild vehicle chase through the streets of San Francisco with a fire engine, an extended clash in Zorin’s mine complex near the San Andreas fault and a thrilling climax at the Golden Gate Bridge.



On the female front, Tanya Roberts is just stunning and has a couple of quality scenes. A year earlier she did "Sheena" where she had to thin down to fit into a skimpy animal-skin bikini (although she still looked great). Meanwhile Grace Jones is a formidable villainous with an interesting story arc. Mary Ann Catrin Stavin also has a quality cameo in the opening teaser.



I shouldn’t close without mentioning critics’ denouncements of Zorin’s psychopathic actions in the mines. I don’t get these whiney criticisms, are Bond villains supposed to be nice guys or something? Zorin is mad and this is what megalomaniacal whack jobs do!

And then, Moore himself looked kind of like Bond in his 70s. He was far too old for the role. Too old to be believable as a super spy. Too old fit the part, and needed to pass on the mantel a few films ago.

They at least made it the worst Bond movie ever by not only making it dull, without motivation, without strategy, without inspiration, without wit, but also by giving it the dumbest title ever (what is a "view to a kill"?) and the absolute worst theme song ever.

A theme song that sounds like fingernails on a chalkboard, and that''s the truth. It''s the worst song Duran Duran ever did. It might be noted that no male artist should ever do a Bond song. The results are terrible. But it''s mostly because the songs are written for a product instead of being inspired. 

Now, the story. Well, it begins with the issue of poorly bred horses being genetically maneuvered, which mirrored the actual events of the time, as it was during the later 80s when a very covert faction in Kentucky had closed meetings for an Equine club.

To put it in a nutshell, some genetic engineering was obviously going on with the thoroughbreds. Six furlong sprinter Mr. Prospector was a big zero as a sire for the 10 furlong derby distance until the Equine club perfomed some covert acts. Either by genetic engineering or by early surgery to change the structutre of the Prospector foals. You see, Mr. Prospector was a Kentucky bred horse owned by the biggest farm in Kentucky.

Well, that idea appears for a second in this movie, and is then never explained again, as if some big shots int he industry hushed it up. 

Meanwhile, Bond is paired with a plain Jane and the hot girls all get killed, to appease the female audience, and since about 1970, movie makers realized it was the women who decided what movies the family would watch in theaters.

Christopher Walken is poorly used in this movie. He really doesn''t do much. He''s just an evil villain. There isn''t any motivation to speak of for any of the characters.

And this latest installment in the “Jurassic” franchise is just such a case. Admittedly, I had more than a few reservations going into this one; I couldn’t help but think that this was a cinematic commodity that had run its course, that it was essentially out of gas to offer anything new of genuine value, and, to a certain degree, that’s true, at least where originality is concerned. However, despite the picture’s expected plunge into familiar territory, director Gareth Edwards’s latest feature offering is nevertheless highly entertaining, even if not particularly groundbreaking. Perhaps that rests with the fact that this is arguably the most Spielbergian installment in the series, in many ways reflective of the iconic production that launched the franchise in 1993. In yet another story involving self-serving agenda-driven characters placing themselves in tremendous peril by venturing into a world of dangerous, genetically manipulated dinosaurs recklessly brought back to life for profit and entertainment purposes, the film follows a narrative formula that most viewers will find more than a little recognizable. But what helps to set this installment apart from many of its predecessors is the quality of the filmmaking itself, specifically its ability to effectively build and maintain tension, its capacity for presenting story arc elements in fresh and inventive ways, and its overall production values, most notably its fine (and occasionally unanticipated) special effects and its efforts in upping the talent quotient of the cast with such commendable additions as Scarlett Johansson and Mahershala Ali. Most importantly, though, this offering is to be applauded for its continuity in staying on track in terms of tone, self-aware of what kind of a movie it truly wants to be. This differentiates “Rebirth” from many of its previous releases, which often couldn’t decide whether they wanted to tell bona fide sci-fi-based tales or present themselves as campy romps (as seen, for example, in the now-famous (or is it infamous?) Bryce Dallas Howard high heel sequences in the first “Jurassic World” offering (2015)). What’s more, Spielberg’s influence in bringing this production to life is clearly present in the finished product, both in terms of honoring the merits of the series’ premiere installment, as well as in its respectful homages to the auteur’s classic 1975 offering, “Jaws.” To be sure, there are some aspects here that are wholly predictable (such as little doubt as to which characters will be offed and when), and there are times when the pacing could stand to be brisker, particularly when the film strives (sometimes a little too hard) to invoke a greater degree of character depth and development than what has typically been the case in previous “Jurassic” releases. In addition, the picture suffers from occasional plot holes, several contrived narrative devices (including one egregiously silly element near the film’s outset that nearly cost me my hopes for the remainder of the release) and more than a little blatantly shameless product placement shots. On balance, though, this is a surprisingly good picture in a series that’s now seven installments deep, an accomplishment that few franchises (other than the “Star Trek” and “007” series) can boast. Don’t be too quick to sell this one short; it may not be perfect, but it’s certainly enjoyable summertime action-adventure fare that makes for a good time on a lazy Saturday afternoon when you don’t feel like going outside to brave the heat.');

By now, these great creatures have largely been taken care of by Mother Nature and have been reduced to living in small groups in equatorial zones around the world where they just want to be left alone to eat and be eaten, protected from a humanity which is “expressly” prohibited from going there. The grasping “Krebs” (Rupert Friend - Orlando Bloom must have been busy) has a plan to cure heart disease and so recruits special ops veteran “Zora” (Scarlett Johansson) to help him secure the living DNA from three of the greatest of these creatures. They wouldn’t know one if they saw one though, so have to convince the nerdy scientist “Loomis” (Jonathan Bailey) to accompany them and their local fixer “Kincaid” (Mahershala Ali) and they head deep into these deadly waters. Meantime, a family are blithely sailing from Bermuda to Cape Town, apparently unaware of the dangers posed by these Vernian monsters. They are dad, young daughter, hormonal older daughter and her bone idle boyfriend, “Xavier” (David Iacono). Boy are they in for a shock when they cross some huge great, and angry, Mosasaurus and end up with most of their boat pointing the wrong way in the water, but with “Xavier” still able to catch some rays whilst they await rescue from, well you can guess who comes, and largely what happens from here on in. For much of the movie, we have two parallel storylines to underwhelm us: the unarmed yet remarkably resilient family have to find an abandoned HQ whilst the mercenaries play a sort of level-by-level game navigating the usual island full of beasties adventures that haven’t really advanced much since it’s nearest biological cousin - “Jurassic Park III” (2001). Oddly enough, I didn’t think these visual effects were anywhere near as effective as in the originals. Maybe we are all just too used to these great animals lumbering about on land, breaching like whales at sea, or swooping and pecking relentlessly from the air? Johansson does join in enthusiastically and Jonathan Bailey really has one one of those smiles on his face that suggests he is enjoying his days in front of the green screen knowing it has to be easier than singing “Not Getting Married” on stage eight times a week - and probably better paid. The others really only make up the numbers, though, with a few characters obviously designated as dino-fodder early-on as it rehashes scenarios from just about everything from “Indian Jones” to “Harry Potter”. It might be like comparing apples and pears, but I have to say I found the current “How to Train Your Dragon” a much more enjoyable adventure about man’s relationship with thick-skinned, scaly, predators, because this entirely forgettable film will do little more than slot nicely into the Christmas television schedules with little, if anything, to distinguish about it once it’s grand scale cinema run has concluded.

One of those mutations was a Distortus Rex, a Tyrannosaur mutation, also known as the D-Rex. Thanks to a Snickers wrapper, the D-Rex escapes, causing the facility to be shut down.



In the present day, five years after the events of Jurassic World: Dominion, dinosaurs are dying out and can no longer survive Earth’s environment. However, closer to the equator, the tropical atmosphere allows them to flourish. ParkerGenix, a pharmaceutical company, wants to manufacture a drug capable of preventing coronary heart disease. But they need to extract blood samples from three of the largest living dinosaurs: Mosasaurus (water), Titanosaurus (land), and Quetzalcoatlus (sky).



So a group of covert operatives decides to travel illegally to Ile Saint-Hubert to retrieve the samples, where they’ll most likely face certain death and where the D-Rex now roams free.



Jurassic World Rebirth is a lot like smashing the first three Jurassic Park films together with disappointing results. Written by David Koepp (Jurassic Park, The Lost World) and directed by Gareth Evans (Godzilla, Rogue One), Rebirth feels like it recycles all of the major action sequences from the Jurassic Park films with no character development whatsoever.



The motive for every character in Rebirth is money. The film gives these moments where it seems like it’s going to reveal some sort of back story or give some sort of reason for you to care about these emotionless doofuses, but the film quickly backtracks or gives a half-ass response before tumbling into non-seriousness.



Zora (Scarlett Johansson) just finished a mission where she lost someone she was close to. Duncan (Mahershala Ali) had a son who died, which caused his marriage to end. The people with Zora and Duncan are just in it for the money, like them. A family is sailing in the Atlantic Ocean as some last hurrah before the college-age daughter goes off to NYU and has the nerve to act like victims when the Mosasaurus wrecks their boat.



Reuben (Manuel Garcia Rulfo) is a dad that decided to take his two daughters and her daughter’s boyfriend (who is a lethargic turd, by the way) out in a boat in the middle of nowhere because “they’d done it before.” His youngest just wants to eat licorice, the NYU-bound daughter makes terrible decisions, and her boyfriend Xavier (David Iacono) is lazy and unlikeable, and you just want to slap this entire family for two hours straight.



The film opens with the D-Rex escape and then flounders about in trite, boring dialogue for 45 minutes until the Mosasaurus shows up. The problem is that you end up despising all of the human characters. Zora doesn’t take anything seriously, Duncan laughs at everything, Henry Loomis (Jonathan Bailey) is a nerdy paleontologist who has no actual qualities about himself apart from his dinosaur knowledge, and everyone else either whines about everything and survives the entire film and whines forever, or is a loud but eventual dinosaur appetizer.



Rebirth does give more screen time to lesser-known dinosaurs, as velociraptors and T-Rexes are reduced to mere cameos. Most of the screen time is split between the Mosasaurus and Quetzalcoatlus, which allows Rebirth to spend more time in the water than previous Jurassic Park and Jurassic World films. Many people get eaten throughout Jurassic World Rebirth, which is satisfying given how painful it is to endure their presence. It’s also interesting that the dinosaurs get more birdlike throughout the franchise. The Quetzalcoatlus sequences are cool because of the claustrophobic nature of its nest and the sheer design of it, which resembles a bird with its feather-like appearance and beak-like nose.



The character development in Rebirth is nullxistent, but so is an actual ending. All these people die, and the survivors settle on doing this one specific thing, and then the credits roll as they’re riding in the boat away from the deadly dinosaur island. There’s all this dialogue about how they shouldn’t go there, how they know it’s stupid, and how it’s highly deadly and illegal. But then everyone acts surprised and angry when people start dying and things go wrong. The entire film is almost as dumb as the D-Rex design.



Jurassic World Rebirth is the worst film of the Jurassic Park/World franchise because it has nothing original to offer. It spends so much time paying homage to the films that came before it that it lacks its own identity. These are some of the most annoying and entitled cinematic characters of the year and you root for them to end up in an archaic intestinal tract and grunted out into antiquated dino shit.');

Leaning hard into nostalgia, director Gareth Edwards peppers his film with sequences that mirror the most memorable moments from the original “Jurassic Park” so closely you can practically hear the 1993 film reel whirring in the background. But instead of feeling like a cheap rehash, these callbacks often land as thrilling homages that give longtime fans the satisfying jolt of seeing familiar sights updated with today’s high-tech CGI. If you love dinosaurs and all things in the series, this is a more than decent seventh installment.



The story picks up five years after the story line in “Jurassic World: Dominion.” Dinosaurs now barely cling to survival and live solely in isolated tropical zones that mimic their prehistoric habitats. At the behest of greedy drug company representative Martin Krebs (Rupert Friend), an expedition is launched to collect DNA from the last three colossal creatures with the intent to manufacture a revolutionary medical breakthrough (and of course, make the company mega rich). Martin assembles a team of mercenaries (Scarlett Johansson, Mahershala Ali) and a dino scientist (Jonathan Bailey) to help, but things take a turn when they rescue a family (Manuel Garcia-Rulfo, Luna Blaise, Audrina Miranda) stranded at sea.  



While the story and tone may be a slightly different shift from the other films, this one still checks many of the usual blockbuster boxes (and sometimes it does so lazily). I caught myself thinking, “Haven’t I seen this before?” several times, but I stayed engaged with the story. Edwards brings a confident hand to the chaos, balancing massive action set pieces with quieter, tense moments that recall Spielberg’s original. Themes of empathy, redemption, and the perils of unchecked scientific ambition are explored, along with some not-so-subtle commentary on human greed and unlikely heroism. The characters are thoughtfully written too, with several showing personal growth during their adventure. By casting accomplished actors, the performances are strong and elevate the material significantly.



The visual effects are by far the best thing about the film, and they are nothing short of jaw-dropping. The dinosaurs look incredibly lifelike, and it’s thrilling to watch them roar and stomp throughout the tropical island. CGI technology has come a long way, and this is one of the best looking films in the entire series.



“Jurassic World Rebirth” knows what it is: a big summer spectacle. On that front, it absolutely delivers. This entertaining thrill ride is pure popcorn entertainment with just enough heart to make you care.

Licence to Kill is directed by John Glen and written by Richard Maibaum and Michael G. Wilson. It''s an original story that uses characters and instances created by Ian Fleming. It stars Timothy Dalton, Carey Lowell, Robert Davi, Talisa Soto, Anthony Zerbe, Desmond Llewelyn, David Hedison, Benicio Del Toro, Frank McRae, Everett McGill and Wayne Newton. Music is scored by Michael Kamen and cinematography by Alec Mills.



Bond 16 and 007 goes rogue when drug baron Franz Sanchez leaves Felix Leiter mutilated and his wife dead. With licence revoked by MI6, Bond has to go it alone to enact revenge for the Leiters.



The controversial Bond for many reasons, Licence to Kill even today has been known to induce fearsome arguments in Bond fan circles. Not since On Her Majesty''s Secret Service has a Bond film so polarised opinions. In one corner are the folks who determine it''s not a Bond movie, in the other is those who say it''s a stripped to the bone human Bond. You either love it or you hate it it seems. True to say that it is more an action thriller than a outright Bond film, no humongous sets, no megalomaniac villain (Davi''s drug baron a very realistic menace) and of course there is Bond being pursued by those that have courted him previously as their number one agent. Yet there''s a whole raft of scenarios that could only exist in a Bond universe, there''s gadgets, too, for those that enjoy that side of Bond. Where else would you see a tanker driving on its side? Or exploding toothpaste and alarm clock, camera''s that turn into weapons and a broom that is actually a transmitter? Not Bondian enough? Really?



Licence to Kill is a superior action thriller movie, the script is tight, the cast ace and the picture is crammed full of exceptional action set pieces. From the pre-credits sequence that sees Bond and Leiter enact a mid-air arrest, to the rather brilliant tanker carnage at the finale, the film rarely pauses for breath, and right there in the centre is a brilliant Dalton giving a rogue Bond plenty of layers. He''s brainy and classy, fallible and driven, intense and tough, always sexy and always dangerous. Dalton''s ability to convey raw emotion as each challenge comes his way is a real treat to watch. But most of all he is right there restoring Bond to being a serious action figure. What Bond fans didn''t realise at the time was that it would be 17 years before Bond would be this raw again, then it would be heralded as a brave new start for Bond!



Another of the film''s strengths is bringing back Hedison as Leiter, last seen playing the role in Live and Let Die, Hedison has great chemistry with Dalton and it''s a joy to see Leiter play an active part in the action on screen. However, the makers do make a misstep by having Leiter be all too jovial at the end of the film, weird since he is minus a limb and his wife was raped and murdered by Sanchez''s henchmen. Another big plus is Lowell''s Pam Bouvier, a tough and brave Bond girl, sexy as heck, her pilot skills come in handy and she''s no mug when it comes to brawling. Lowell does fine work in the role and keeps it away from being a token interest cliché. Davi keeps Sanchez as believable, a very driven drug baron who is cultured and funny, but always pulsing a vicious streak, while McRae has presence, McGill neatly keeps the cards close to his chest, Del Toro a nice line in nastiness and Soto is pretty as a picture and plays Lupe Lamora with skilled vulnerability. And of course there''s Llewelyn as Q, who here gets a right old meaty role as he goes out in the field to become Bond''s only aid from MI6. Again, not Bondian enough?



Licence to Kill saw the end of Dalton''s tenure as Bond, legal issues between Danjaq and MGM/UA meant that no Bond movie would be made for another six years. By then Dalton had moved on to other work and was 51. It also marked the end of production duties for Cubby Broccoli, the final direction by John Glen (5 Bond films in total), Richard Maibaum''s last script and the last performances by Robert Brown as M and Caroline Bliss as Moneypenney. One of the many misconceptions about the Dalton era is that Licence to Kill was a flop, it made $156 million worldwide, considerably down on The Living Daylights but more than A View to a Kill. A huge profit of over $100 million, this in spite of it being pitched against Batman and sequels to beloved American films by a studio head who had no idea how to market a film. The best actor to take on the role of Bond, Dalton''s impact on the series cannot be overstated, he (rightly so) is very proud of his work in the two films and still talks very fondly of a role he respected beyond compare. 9/10');

Released in 1989, "Licence to Kill" always struck me as the most atypical Bond film. In this one James (Timothy Dalton) goes rogue after a good friend''s bride is murdered and the friend is half-eaten by a shark. Stripped of his authority, Bond vengefully goes after the responsible drug lord, Sanchez (Robert Davi).



The opening act drives home that "Licence to Kill" is a more serious and brutal Bond flick. Although there''s still a lot of "yeah, right" moments, the comedic edge of past Bond films is all but gone. And the violence is so savage and merciless compared to past films that it almost comes off shocking.



In addition, the spectacular globe-trotting locations are absent in favor of a more one-dimensional setting -- the Florida Keys and Mexico (where the film was shot). Although they do fine with these limited locales, the change is noticeable.



The women are below par as well. Carey Lowell works best as the "Bond girl," but she pales in comparison to, say, Lois Chiles, Luciana Paluzzi and Claudine Auger. Talisa Soto is also on hand as Sanchez'' girl and, briefly, Priscilla Barnes.



The opening stunt sequence is alright, but it''s unmemorable compared to past Bond films, like "The Living Daylights," "The Spy Who Loved Me" and "Moonraker."



Furthermore, there''s an under-developed subplot about a cult guru and the film seems overlong at 133 minutes.



But the movie scores points with effective villains (it wouldn''t be right to say "good villains", would it?), particularly Davi and a young Benicio Del Toro, both cruel and sadistic.



FINAL SAY: The fun might be over, but at least they tried something different to stir things up. Unfortunately, it didn''t quite work. "Licence to Kill" performed weakly at the box office and ranks with the lesser Bond flicks. Still, it''s interesting as an atypical part of the series -- darker and grittier, albeit still comic booky. Plus Dalton is striking as the vengeful protagonist and, if you can hang around till the final act, it''s totally kick-axx.

And for those of you who are obsessed with Bondlore, this is the 007 film that references the events in OHMSS which proves that Bond is one person and not just a "title" like the people who are trying to completely rewrite the franchise to inject modern politics over story and fun.



Anyway, moving on, this, like The Living Daylights, the closest Bond to Flemming''s 007 and the closest Bond to the cold blooded assassin of the early Connery films to-date. So it has always come across as odd that so many people that love Connery 007 hate Dalton.



It''s also a break away from MI6 and shows Bond going out on his own to avenge Felix, who is the US counterpart to his character.



It moves away from a lot of the 007 tropes in story alone, but it also tells a completely different story with a Bond that is far closer to the source material than anything we had seen before.

License to Kill marked a major shift in the franchise away from the campy, goofy, and almost family-friendly Roger Moore Bind films to something darker and more brutal. Timothy Dalton’s Bond is savage and emotional, using only his wits to track down an elusive drug lord and devising an elaborate scheme to exact revenge and cripple the entire drug enterprise. No longer are the jokes and gadgets the focus, but instead, the violence and rage of Bond and the villains he faces take center stage. Characters are eaten by sharks, crushed, exploded, and more in barbaric ways with incredible stunts and a more grounded sobering story. License to Kill finds its influence in Miami Vice and benefits from a less outrageous or fantastical story. Unfortunately, License to Kill was before its time as Brosnan’s Bond slid the franchise back to the far-fetched goofy extremes of Bond. Thankfully the Craig era returned to what Dalton began with a nuanced and volatile character in a more believable world of spies and danger. License to Kill is one of the best in the Bond franchise and shamefully underrated.');

This begins an era of "no fun" 007 films, where the wit is very minimal and every scene is whiplash brutal.

However, unlike most later 007 films, this one stays true to its design. It doesn''t try to "contrive" the story. Instead, there is a flow.

One interesting aspect is that we see something worse than "death", as is pointed out earlier, with David Hedison getting brutal treatment in his recurring Felix role.

We see the beginning of an era where evil is in charge of the world. No longer is there anyone to be trusted outside of a few men like James and Felix.

There is a "darkest before the Dawn" scenario here, but it isn''t "contrived" the way later 007 movies do it. 

There is a lot going for this one. Unfortunately, it set the style for "no fun in 007 films", which ultimately saw the writing and directing get worse and worse. But this one works. Bond is still a genuinely okay guy, and that''s what always keeps 007 films going.');
