    SET biography = N'Julie Gayet (born 3 June 1972) is a French actress and film producer. She is also known for being the wife of the former President of France, François Hollande.

Gayet was born in Suresnes, Hauts-de-Seine, where her father Brice Gayet is a professor and head of gastric surgery at the Institut Mutualiste Montsouris. He was former head of the clinic to the Lariboisière Hospital and lecturer at the Faculty Xavier Bichat at Paris Diderot University. Her mother is an antique dealer. Her paternal grandfather, Alain Gayet, was also a surgeon and became a Compagnon de la Libération after World War II. She received a social liberal intellectual upbringing.

Gayet studied art history and psychology at university, circus skills at the circus school of the Fratellini family, and operatic singing under Tosca Marmor. At the age of 17, she studied at the Actors Studio in London with Jack Waltzer, and then continued at the Tania Balachova School in Paris.

Gayet made her acting debut in a 1992 episode of the French TV series Premiers baisers, and had her first film role as an extra in Three Colors: Blue (1993), but her first role of public note was in the 1996 comedy Delphine 1, Yvan 0 by Dominique Farrugia.

Her musical performances include playing in video-clips for Benjamin Biolay and singing a duet with Marc Lavoine.

In 2007, she founded her own production company, Rouge International, with Nadia Turincev and produced films such as The Ride by Stephanie Gillard, Fix me by Palestinian Raed Andonia and Bonsai by Cristian Jimenez of Chile.

In 2013, Gayet co-directed with Mathieu Busson the documentary Cinéast(e)s featuring 20 French female film directors.

Gayet appeared on the cover of the 17 January 2014 issue of the French Elle magazine. The issue hit newsstands on 15 January 2014, two days ahead of its usual release day. The headline read "Julie Gayet, Actress and Committed Woman, a French Passion".

In 2003, Gayet married author and screenwriter Santiago Amigorena, but they divorced in 2006. The couple have two children.

Gayet is a centre-left activist, having appeared in a video supporting François Hollande during the 2012 French presidential election. She is a member of the Support Committee of the PS candidate for the 2014 Paris mayoral election, Anne Hidalgo. She also supported same-sex marriage in France.

In 2013 rumours started circulating that Gayet was in a secret relationship with President Hollande. On 10 January 2014, a story in the tabloid Closer featured seven pages of alleged revelations and photos about the affair, provoking wider media coverage. Hollande said he "regretted this violation of his private life" and was "thinking about" pursuing a legal response, but did not deny the substance of the story. The 10 January issue was so popular that Closer "reprinted the issue, with a further 150,000 copies scheduled to hit newsstands" on 15 January 2014. On 16 January 2014, the AFP news agency reported that Gayet would sue Closer for €50,000 in damages and €4,000 in legal costs. ...

Sir James Matthew Barrie, 1st Baronet, OM (9 May 1860 – 19 June 1937) was a Scottish author and dramatist, best remembered today as the creator of Peter Pan. The child of a family of small-town weavers, he was educated in Scotland. He moved to London, where he developed a career as a novelist and playwright. There he met the Llewelyn Davies boys who inspired him in writing about a baby boy who has magical adventures in Kensington Gardens (included in The Little White Bird), then to write Peter Pan, or The Boy Who Wouldnullt Grow Up, a "fairy play" about this ageless boy and an ordinary girl named Wendy who have adventures in the fantasy setting of Neverland. This play quickly overshadowed his previous work and although he continued to write successfully, it became his best-known work, credited with popularising the name Wendy, which was very uncommon previously. Barrie unofficially adopted the Davies boys following the deaths of their parents. Before his death, he gave the rights to the Peter Pan works to Great Ormond Street Hospital, which continues to benefit from them.

    SET biography = N'Toronto/Montreal-based Russell Yuen is one of Canadanulls busiest character actors.

Like most actors Yuen spent his early career doing an assortment of jobs to make ends meet while he became established. Unlike most actors it wasnullt waiting tables or serving drinks. A dedicated athlete, Yuen spent his time as a white water rescuer and rafting guide in Northern Quebec, ran a Nautilus facility and worked as a fitness trainer. Yuen is also an enthusiastic scuba diver, a mountain and ice-climber, an in-line skater, a mountain biker and a fencer.

A former martial artist in Shaolin, Yuen used his stunt skills to move from bit parts, playing Asian gangsters and fighters, into meatier roles. His breakout opportunity came with The Red Violin and more feature film parts quickly followed for this versatile young actor whose skills range from action, to drama, to broad comedy. Other screen performances include Bulletproof Monk directed by John Woo, Owning Mahoney and Long Life, Happiness and Prosperity. He has appeared in Billy Raynulls Shattered Glass, David Weavernulls Indie feature Century Hotel; Between the Moon and Montevideo; Phillip Noycenulls The Bone Collector, opposite Denzel Washington; David Mametnulls The Heist; Ron Underwoodnulls Pluto Nash, opposite Eddie Murphy, and Stephan Elliotnulls Eye Of The Beholder. Well known to Quebec audiences for his film work Yuen starred in the Quebec feature film Ballade des Dangereux, directed by Louis Saia.

Yuen has an extensive list of television credits on both English and French projects and series. He was most recently featured on the popular French series Jack Carter, in the recurring role of impotent mobster "Wong Phat". He has a recurring role in Diva and other recent television credits include principal roles in: Relic Hunter; The Associates; A Touch of Hope; and The Adventures of Jules Verne. Television credits also include multiple appearances in Kung Fu:The Legend Continues, and roles in Urban Angel, Counterstrike, John Woonulls Once A Thief, and PSI Factor.

Fluently bilingual (French/English) Yuen maintains homes in both Toronto and Montreal. A fourth-generation Canadian, born and raised in the Montreal suburbs of St. Laurent and Pierrefond, with deep connections to Vancouver (all of his extended family live there still), Yuen was guided by his parents to become a doctor. However, his studies came to an abrupt halt when a chance Drama elective turned into a full-time pursuit. After studying Theatre at Concordia University, in the honors program, he quickly moved into film and television where he has found continuing success.

    SET biography = N'James McDougall is a Canadian actor and filmmaker. He was raised in the small town of Cobourg Ontario, the son of Gail McDougall, a prison manager, and John McDougall, an English teacher. Throughout elementary and high school, acting and filmmaking were always a passion for James. Whether it was performing in local plays, school theater, or filming his own home movies with friends.

This led him to major in drama at Canterbury Arts High School and he went on to York University to study theater for one year. James then moved back to Ottawa to begin performing on stage in musicals and dramatic productions with ASNY, Orleans Young Players, and GOYA. He ventured to Victoria B.C. and acted in shows with Atomic Vaudeville, Theatre Inconnu, and Langham Court Theater.

After a few years in British Columbia James traveled back to his home province of Ontario and embraced the film and television scene in Toronto. He immersed himself in the world of on-camera acting and filmmaking. By creating his own projects, training and constantly honing his craft, and working at Armstrong Acting Studios where he filmed thousands of hours of classes as well as casting sessions with some the top casting directors in Canada, James got to know the industry from the inside out as he quickly built up his on-screen resume.

A few breakout roles include getting cast as the lead actor in Vincenzo Natalinulls segment in the anthology horror film ABCs of Death 2 (2014), playing Santa Claus in Michael Dowsenulls heartwarming HBO Max film 8-Bit Christmas (2021) and landing a supporting role as the bumbling criminal Hammond in Jonathan Milott and Cary Murnionulls hit thriller Becky (2020) where he acted alongside Kevin James, Lulu Wilson, and Joel McHale.

James has also spent over a decade working behind the scenes writing, directing, and producing content at Mountain Man Media. Walking Supply (2016), a short film he co-wrote with Derek Barnes, went on to debut at The Toronto International Short Film Festival. The concept was soon developed into the feature film Whiteout (2023), which James not only co-wrote but starred in as the role of Henry. The harrowing survival thriller was filmed in the dead of winter, sold at the Cannes Film Market, and landed distribution with Saban Films and Myriad Pictures.

In 2021, James founded his own production company called Galebreak Studios, which focuses on telling captivating narrative stories of all genres, both short and feature length.', dob = '1986-03-30', photo_url = 'https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/ounyHPElQ6jYcCGITmTdVJuiz5n.jpg'

    SET biography = N'Carla Hool is a Mexican-born casting director with over two decades of experience in both U.S. and Latin American film and television. Raised in Mexico City and from a lineage deeply rooted in entertainment—her grandmother was the Mexican Golden Age actress and dancer Constanza Hool, and her father is producer Conrad Hool—she was exposed to film production from an early age. She developed a passion for casting early in her career.

She first worked supervising casting under her father’s guidance, and one of her earliest international credits came with Man on Fire (2004), co-produced by her father. Two years later, she earned her first standalone U.S. casting credit on Apocalypto (2006). After moving to Los Angeles around 2007, she continued to expand her career internationally, taking on a wide variety of casting projects while advocating for authentic representation of Latino talent.

Across her career, she has worked on more than 100 films and television series, including major productions like Coco(2017) for which she won an Artios Award, Narcos (2015), Narcos: Mexico (2018), Black Panther: Wakanda Forever(2022), Flamin’ Hot (2023), and Emilia Pérez (2024).

Her professionalism and contributions have been recognised with several awards. She received NALIP’s Industry Pioneer Award in 2019, won the 2022 Heller Award for Feature Casting Director of the Year, and has had multiple nominations and wins from the Casting Society of America’s Artios Awards. She was invited to join the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in 2020.

Carla Hool is fluent in English and Spanish, with proficiency in Italian and some French. She continues to split her professional focus between projects in Los Angeles and international work, particularly across Latin America and Spain, pushing for authentic portrayals of Latino characters—not limited to stereotypical roles—while adhering to the highest standards of casting in Hollywood and abroad.', dob = null, photo_url = 'https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/4n9pbehYIrArk5CGRnMBeqmOQa5.jpg'

After many odd jobs, sales was his niche, but stunts always loomed in the background. He was a successful food broker, selling steak and seafood door to door throughout the Chicagoland area. When a stunt school opened in Chicago in 1988, Joe jumped at the opportunity. From there, he honed his stunt skills and learned about the motion picture industry, hustling sets and working as an extra. After several years he hustled the sets and got his big break doubling for Steven Seagal and hasnullt looked back. Since then, Joe has also doubled for Arnold Schwarzenegger, Will Ferrell, John Cusack, Jeff Goldblum, David Hasselhoff, Dan Marino, and Vince Vaughn.

Hawk gained significant fame for completing the first 900 as well as his licensed video game titles distributed by Activision. He is widely considered one of the most successful and influential pioneers of modern vertical skateboarding.

Raised in San Diego, California, Hawk was described as being "hyperactive" as a child. His parents supported his skateboarding because it served as an outlet for his excessive energy, and as Hawknulls skills developed, he became a professional skateboarder at age fourteen. In 1999, he became the first skater to land a 900. In 2002, he created the Boom Boom HuckJam, an extreme sports exhibition and tour which launched in Las Vegas. Throughout his career, Hawk has made numerous appearances in films and other media, as well as his own series of video games. He has also been involved in various philanthropic activities including his own Tony Hawk Foundation which helps build skateparks in underprivileged areas, and also including collaborations with other athletes in the charity Athletes for Hope.

    SET biography = N'George Cottle is a highly competent second unit director and stunt coordinator who has gained recognition in the business for his work on successful films such as Barbie (2023), Oppenheimer (2023), and Tenet (2020). Cottle made a seamless move from the stunt industry to directing, lending his distinct viewpoint and experience to some of the most elaborate action scenes in Hollywood.

He started his career in the stunt profession in the middle of the 1990s, and in 1997 he was formally included to the British Stunt Register. His breakthrough performance was with Plunkett & Macleane in 1999, when he pulled off a risky stunt involving a blazing carriage drawn by horses. Cottle honed his precision driving abilities as a stunt driver in the early years, working on British TV series such as Coronation Street and Cold Feet. His early experiences equipped him to tackle more difficult stunts on larger-scale movie sets.

George Cottlenulls career took off in 2002 after he made an appearance in the James Bond film Die Another Day.

He was nominated for a Taurus World Stunt Award in 2003 in the category of "Best Work With A Vehicle," together with fellow stunt performer Ray De Haan, as a result of this project, which was a major turning point in his career.

Cottle took on more challenging tasks as his career progressed, eventually moving from stunt performer to stunt coordinator and second unit director.

His work on Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 (2010), The Dark Knight (2008), and Inception (2010) showed off his ability to plan and carry out complex stunt scenes that aesthetically complement the narrative. He has a well-earned reputation for pulling off daring yet safe stunts that test the limits of cinematography.

His work on Tenet presented additional difficulties, particularly in designing stunts that complemented the filmnulls narrative that bends time. His adaptability to a variety of situations and storylines has made him a priceless tool for filmmakers. As a premier stunt coordinator and second unit director, he has further solidified his reputation with his work on Oppenheimer and Spider-Man: No Way Home (2021).

George Cottle is renowned for his contributions to a number of eagerly awaited Hollywood productions. Among the recent films he worked on were directing the second unit for Barbie (2023) and supervising stunt coordination for Deadpool & Wolverine (2024). He maintains his leadership position in the market because to his capacity to innovate and take on new challenges.

Cottlenulls career is a testament to his enthusiasm, originality, and commitment to quality in the stunt industry. He began his career at Pinewood Studios as a young assistant and worked his way up to become a well-known second unit director and stunt coordinator. His story is an encouraging one of skill and perseverance. Cottle is still a major player in Hollywood, constantly pushing the limits of action filmmaking and stunt coordination with every new movie he takes on.', dob = null, photo_url = 'https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/hGvlKt3Zm7rpO6I9RXFRWGmZUw0.jpg'

In 2000, Jwaundace and her partners in Caged Heat became WOWnulls 1st Tag Team Champions becoming WOWnulls most popular Tag Team in history.

Because of much exposure, Jwaundace was recruited into the stunt world. She was approached to be a stunt double for Queen Latifah in "Bringing Down the House". That fight scene she did for Queen Latifah earned her a "Best Fight" nomination at the MTV Movie Awards in 2004. After that, Jwaundace decided to perform more stunt work to gain recognition to transfer into acting.

After performing in over 75 filming and TV shows, performing stunts for Oscar and Emmy nominated and winning actresses such as Viola Davis, MonullNique, Jennifer Hudson, Queen Latifah, Whoopi Goldberg, Oprah Winfrey, etc., she moved back to Atlanta in 2010 to give birth and raise her son. While in Atlanta, she shifted her focus on stunts to acting booking roles on "Banshee", "Conan", "Letnulls Stay Together", and recurring roles on ABCnulls "Resurrection" as Mrs. Camille Thompson (mom to Omar Epps). She got the most recognition in her debut film, 20th Century Foxnulls "Letnulls Be Cops". She ad-libbed the line nullThatnulls What You Getnull, while filming. The director, Luke Greenfield, and writer, Nicholas Thomas, decided to keep it in the scene and it paid off by being a major part of their marketing campaign.

He is widely known for his horror novels and has been crowned the "King of Horror". He has also explored other genres: suspense, crime, science-fiction, fantasy, and mystery. Though known primarily for his novels, he has written approximately 200 short stories, most of which have been published in collections.

His debut, Carrie (1974), established him in horror. Different Seasons (1982), a collection of four novellas, was his first major departure from the genre. Among the films adapted from Kingnulls fiction are Carrie (1976), The Shining (1980), The Dead Zone and Christine (both 1983), Stand by Me(1986), Misery (1990), The Shawshank Redemption (1994), Dolores Claiborne (1995), The Green Mile (1999), The Mist (2007), and It (2017). He has published under the pseudonym Richard Bachman and has co-written works with other authors, notably his friend Peter Straub and sons Joe Hill and Owen King. He has also written nonfiction, notably Danse Macabre (1981) and On Writing: A Memoir of the Craft (2000).

Among other awards, King has won the O. Henry Award for "The Man in the Black Suit" (1994) and the Los Angeles Times Book Prize for Mystery/Thriller for 11/22/63 (2011). He has also won honours for his overall contributions to literature, including the 2003 Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters, the 2007 Grand Master Award from the Mystery Writers of America and the 2014 National Medal of Arts. Joyce Carol Oates called King "a brilliantly rooted, psychologically nullrealisticnull writer for whom the American scene has been a continuous source of inspiration, and American popular culture a vast cornucopia of possibilities."

    SET biography = N'Marius Re Goring CBE FRSL (May 23, 1912 – September 30, 1998) was an English stage and screen actor. He is the son of Dr Charles Buckman Goring, a renowned physician and criminologist, and Kate Winifred (née MacDonald), a former suffragette and talented pianist. Marius Goring was educated at The Perse School, Cambridge, England and at universities in Frankfurt, Munich, Vienna and Paris (The Sorbonne) where he perfected his French and German - he became fluent in both languages. He studied for the stage under Harcourt Williams at the Old Vic dramatic school, London. His first stage appearance was a fairy at the ADC Theatre, Cambridge in 1925 at the age of twelve in "Crossings: A Fairy Play" the only play written by Walter De La Mare. His first London appearance was at the Rudolph Steiner Hall in December 1927 as Harlequin in one of Jean Sterling McKinlay’s Children’s Matinees. He performed regularly at the Old Vic and Sadlernulls Wells in the 1930s and later toured France and Germany. He played Macbeth, Romeo, Trip in School for Scandal and the Chorus in Henry V with Laurence Olivier amongst others. His first West End appearance was at the Shaftesbury Theatre in May 1934 in The Voysey Inheritance.

He joined the army in July 1940 but was seconded the following year to the BBC where he became supervisor of productions for its German Service. He made regular propaganda broadcasts to Germany. Most of his radio propaganda work was done under the alias Charles Richardson (using his father’s first name and his grandmother’s maiden name) as the name Goring wasnullt too popular during the war (Hermann Göring was the commander-in-chief of the Luftwaffe).

In 1941 he was married for the second time to the renowned German Jewish actress Lucie Mannheim who had to flee Germany in 1934 after the Nazis came to power. They worked together on stage and in films and television many times over the following years.

He was a founder member of British Equity in 1929, being on its council for decades from 1949 and was elected its vice president three times.

    SET biography = N'From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.  Lucie Mannheim (30 April 1899 – 28 July 1976) was a German singer and actress.

Mannheim was born in Berlin–Köpenick where she studied drama and quickly became a popular figure appearing on stage in plays and musicals. Among other roles, she played Nora in Ibsenulls A Dollnulls House, Marie in Büchnernulls Woyzeck, and Juliet in Shakespearenulls Romeo and Juliet. She also began a film career in 1923, appearing in several silent and sound films including Atlantik (1929) – the first of many versions of the story of the ill-fated RMS Titanic. The composer Walter Goetze wrote his operetta Die göttliche Jette (1931) especially for Mannheim.  However, as a Jew she was obliged to stop acting in 1933, when her contract at the State Theatre was cancelled. She promptly left Germany, first to Czechoslovakia, then to Britain. She appeared in several films there, notably as the doomed spy Annabella Smith in Alfred Hitchcocknulls 1935 version of The 39 Steps.

During World War II she appeared in several films, as well as broadcasting propaganda to Germany – including performing an anti-Hitler version of Lili Marleen  in 1943. In 1941, she married the actor Marius Goring.

She returned to Germany in 1948 and resumed her career as an actress on stage and in film. In 1955 she joined the cast of the British television series The Adventures of the Scarlet Pimpernel as Countess La Valliere. She made her final English-language film appearance in the 1965 film Bunny Lake Is Missing. Her last appearance was in a 1970 TV movie. She died in Braunlage.

He is perhaps best known for directing the 1945 film The Seventh Veil and the 1950 version of the film King Solomonulls Mines, an adaptation of an Allan Quatermain story.

Bennett was born in Tunbridge Wells, England. At the beginning of his career, he worked as a band leader and a commercial artist before trying his hand at amateur filmmaking. One of these early films helped him land a job at Alexander Kordanulls London Films in 1932. There, he became a film editor; later he would help make instructional and propaganda films for the British armed forces during World War II.

Bennettnulls films tended to be sombre, but were very popular with the moviegoing public. In 1946, Bennett accepted an invitation to go to Hollywood for Universal.

It was, however, during this time that he directed King Solomonulls Mines. He was replaced during filming by Andrew Marton.

Bennett eventually returned to the UK. From 1954 to 1957, he left film work to pursue interests in the theatre and television, but produced four films in 1957, After the Ball, Man-Eater, That Woman Opposite and The Flying Scot.

    SET biography = N'Chad Wiebe is a Canadian visual effects supervisor at Industrial Light & Magic. Born and raised in Manitoba, he attended Red River College, where he initially studied graphic design and illustration. While enrolled in the Advanced Diploma Program, he had the opportunity to focus on computer animation. This turning point shifted his passion from graphic design to visual effects in film.

He began his industry career at Frantic Films (now Prime Focus) in Winnipeg, where he spent eleven years working as a generalist, computer graphics artist, and digital effects specialist. He rose through the ranks and, in 2008, was promoted to visual effects supervisor—a role he would continue to develop over the following decade.

Wiebenulls early credits include high‑intensity simulation-based sequences such as the explosions in Swordfish (2001), the slow‑motion train battle in Sucker Punch (2011), and the bridge collapse in Final Destination 5 (2011). These sequences showcased his expertise in destruction and heavy simulation effects. He later contributed to major blockbuster tentpoles, including the oil rig collapse and tornado scenes in Man of Steel (2013), and multiple Marvel projects such as Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015), Doctor Strange (2016), and Thor: Ragnarok (2017).

In the fall of 2016, Wiebe joined Industrial Light & Magicnulls Vancouver studio as a visual effects supervisor. Since then, he has overseen VFX work on numerous high‑profile film and television projects. His recent roles include supervising Marvelnulls Thunderbolts (2025), where he helped define the look of the Void character and bring New York City environments to life. That production timeline began in mid‑2023, paused during the WGA strike, and saw Wiebe joining ILMnulls involvement in early 2024.

Wiebe has received industry recognition for his work. In 2021, he earned nominations at the Hollywood Professional Association (HPA) Awards for Outstanding Visual Effects – Theatrical Feature for Jungle Cruise (2021), where he was jointly credited through ILM, and for Outstanding Visual Effects – Episodic (Under 13 Episodes) for Loki: Journey Into Mystery (2021).', dob = null, photo_url = 'https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/pDvvnFSJV7x4TRBU7K4CO6gCZNF.jpg'

    SET biography = N'Barrie Gower is a five-time Emmy-winning prosthetics designer.

Gower grew up in the north of England, where his father managed a cinema. As he became a teenager, he became heavily involved in art—mostly drawings and sculpture.

Still, in those early days, his mission felt like more “of a pipe dream.” With the support of his mom, Gower applied for art programmes, stumbling upon one promising option at the London College of Fashion. He didnullt get into the university in the first year, as he didnullt have any evidence of doing any hairstyling or makeup (although he had a portfolio). His mother enrolled him in a hairdressing course, and the following year he was accepted at LCF, where he “managed to meet quite a lot of industry professionals.” Barrie began his career in the film industry in 1996 after graduating from the London College of Fashion with a HND in Specialist Make-up. His first role was at the BBC Visual Effects Department on projects including ‘Red Dwarf’ and ‘Silent Witness’. The following year, Barrie was employed on his first major feature film, Steven Spielbergnulls nullSaving Private Ryanull. Barrie has since worked for industry-leading companies and individuals such as Weta Workshop and multi-award winner Rick Baker. Barrie contributed to the Academy Award-winning prosthetics for nullThe Wolfmanull (2011) and nullThe Iron Ladynull (2012).

After 10 years working in the Harry Potter film world and then freelancing on other large-scale projects, Gower decided to start his own company, BGFX, with his wife, Sarah, also a prosthetics designer. They’d met working on a film in Budapest. At that time, she was part of the CGI visual effects department. BGFX began as an at-home studio but quickly launched into the big leagues when it received its first major opportunity: designing prosthetics for season four of HBO’s Game of Thrones. Thrones was the beginning of a fruitful relationship with HBO, one that has seen the couple spearheading designs for many more of the network’s biggest hits, among them House of the Dragon and The Last of Us. For the former, the job primarily centred around the ageing and decay of Paddy Considine’s character, the doomed king Viserys Targaryen.

Simultaneously, BGFX was handling The Last of Us, which Gower is quick to describe as “the biggest thing we’ve ever done.” For that series, the company was tasked with designing and executing a whole world consumed by a fungus, plus the resulting zombie-like creatures that are born out of those spores. They didn’t have to start from scratch, however, relying on the catalogue of work created for the original 2013 video game by developer Naughty Dog.', dob = null, photo_url = 'https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/w4aurjKq2sIGPHZSpjLDp6BIHV2.jpg'

He rose through the ranks of a family-run business called Timely Comics, which later became Marvel Comics. He was Marvelnulls primary creative leader for two decades, expanding it from a small publishing house division to a multimedia corporation that dominated the comics and film industries.

In collaboration with others at Marvel—particularly co-writers and artists Jack Kirby and Steve Ditko—he co-created iconic characters, including Spider-Man, the X-Men, Iron Man, Thor, the Hulk, Ant-Man, the Wasp, the Fantastic Four, Black Panther, Daredevil, Doctor Strange, the Scarlet Witch, and Black Widow. These and other charactersnull introductions in the 1960s pioneered a more naturalistic approach in superhero comics. In the 1970s, Lee challenged the restrictions of the Comics Code Authority, indirectly leading to changes in its policies. In the 1980s, he pursued the development of Marvel properties in other media, with mixed results.

Following his retirement from Marvel in the 1990s, Lee remained a public figurehead for the company. He frequently made cameo appearances in films and television shows based on Marvel properties, on which he received an executive producer credit, which allowed him to become the person with the highest-grossing film total ever. He continued independent creative ventures until his death, aged 95, in 2018. Lee was inducted into the comic book industrynulls Will Eisner Award Hall of Fame in 1994 and the Jack Kirby Hall of Fame in 1995. He received the NEAnulls National Medal of Arts in 2008.

    SET biography = N'Jack Kirby (born Jacob Kurtzberg; August 28, 1917 – February 6, 1994) was an American comic book artist, widely regarded as one of the mediumnulls major innovators and one of its most prolific and influential creators. He grew up in New York City and learnt to draw cartoon figures by tracing characters from comic strips and editorial cartoons. He entered the nascent comics industry in the 1930s, drawing various comics features under different pen names, including Jack Curtiss, before settling on Jack Kirby. In 1940, he and writer-editor Joe Simon created the highly successful superhero character Captain America for Timely Comics, predecessor of Marvel Comics. During the 1940s, Kirby regularly teamed with Simon, creating numerous characters for that company and for National Comics Publications, later to become DC Comics.

After serving in the European Theatre in World War II, Kirby produced work for DC Comics, Harvey Comics, Hillman Periodicals, and other publishers. At Crestwood Publications, he and Simon created the genre of romance comics and later founded their own short-lived comic company, Mainline Publications. Kirby was involved in Timelynulls 1950s iteration, Atlas Comics, which in the next decade became Marvel. There, in the 1960s, Kirby cocreated many of the companynulls major characters, including Ant-Man, the Avengers, the Black Panther, the Fantastic Four, the Hulk, Iron Man, the Silver Surfer, Thor, and the X-Men, among many others. Kirbynulls titles garnered high sales and critical acclaim, but in 1970, feeling he had been treated unfairly, largely in the realm of authorship credit and creatorsnull rights, Kirby left the company for rival DC.

At DC, Kirby created his Fourth World saga, which spanned several comic titles. While these series proved commercially unsuccessful and were cancelled, the Fourth Worldnulls New Gods have continued as a significant part of the DC Universe. Kirby returned to Marvel briefly in the mid-to-late 1970s and then ventured into television animation and independent comics. In his later years, Kirby, who has been called "the William Blake of comics," began receiving great recognition in the mainstream press for his career accomplishments, and in 1987 he was one of the three inaugural inductees of the Will Eisner Comic Book Hall of Fame. In 2017, Kirby was posthumously named a Disney Legend for his creations not only in the field of publishing but also because those creations formed the basis for The Walt Disney Companynulls financially and critically successful media franchise, the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

Kirby was married to Rosalind Goldstein in 1942. They had four children and remained married until his death from heart failure in 1994, at the age of 76. The Jack Kirby Awards and Jack Kirby Hall of Fame were named in his honour, and he is known as "The King" among comics fans for his many influential contributions to the medium.

He often credits his mentors, including Lisa Churgin and Pam Martin, for shaping both his creative approach and professional ethos.

In television, Gibson has worked on notable television series, including Marvel Studios’ Hawkeye (2021), where he served as editor on episodes “Never Meet Your Heroes” and “Hide and Seek”. He has also edited projects like Safety and Think Like a Dog (2020).

In a February 2021 profile for the Motion Picture Editors Guild’s “Cut to Black” series, Gibson reflected on early cinematic influences such as Alfred Hitchcock’s Rear Window and the PBS documentary Eyes on the Prize, which helped ignite his passion for storytelling and editing. He expressed a steadfast belief that “it’s not just how you start, it’s how you finish,” a tenet he attributes to Lisa Churgin and carries with him through each project. Remembering his earliest on-camera appearance, he recounted a small acting moment in Jonathan Demme’s Beloved before realising that his true calling lay behind the editing suite.', dob = null, photo_url = 'https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/ytrVgfS3iJgPUGkSCSCUMcG88nR.jpg'

    SET biography = N'Born in India and raised in the U.S., George Hull started his creative path with a BFA Degree in Industrial Design. Growing up in a small midwest town, a career in the film industry seemed impossible—a "ridiculous" pursuit he was told by his instructors. But Georgenulls dreams for film design became reality when Lucasfilmnulls prestigious visual effects company, Industrial Light & Magic, noticed his talent and offered him a position on their creative team, just out of school. At ILM, Georgenulls earliest credit was Oscar winner Forrest Gump. He then quickly climbed to be a lead Visual Effects Art Director, working on films like Mission Impossible, Jurassic Park 2, Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back, and Return of the Jedi special editions. 

After 6 years at ILM, George left to form George Hull Design. As an independent, he is always pursuing the most creative stage of a filmnulls visual development. As one of Hollywoodnulls leading conceptual designers, George specialises in creating unique and imaginative worlds, including the cinematography, settings, and vehicles that live within them. Recently George worked as a Senior Conceptual Designer on the highly acclaimed Dune as well as Blade Runner 2049, Star Wars IIV, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, The Cloud Atlas, V for Vendetta, the science fiction epic The Matrix Reloaded, The Matrix Revolutions and The Matrix Resurrections, and The Batman and Thor: Love & Thunder.

    SET biography = N'From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Henrik Johan Ibsen (20 March 1828 – 23 May 1906) was a Norwegian playwright and theatre director. As one of the founders of modernism in theatre, Ibsen is often referred to as "the father of realism" and one of the most influential playwrights of his time. His major works include Brand, Peer Gynt, An Enemy of the People, Emperor and Galilean, A Dollnulls House, Hedda Gabler, Ghosts, The Wild Duck, When We Dead Awaken, Rosmersholm, and The Master Builder. He is the most frequently performed dramatist in the world after Shakespeare, and A Dollnulls House was the worldnulls most performed play in 2006.

Ibsenulls early poetic and cinematic play Peer Gynt has strong surreal elements. After Peer Gynt Ibsen abandoned verse and wrote in realistic prose. Several of his later dramas were considered scandalous to many of his era, when European theatre was expected to model strict morals of family life and propriety. Ibsenulls later work examined the realities that lay behind the facades, revealing much that was disquieting to a number of his contemporaries. He had a critical eye and conducted a free inquiry into the conditions of life and issues of morality. In many criticsnull estimates The Wild Duck and Rosmersholm are "vying with each other as rivals for the top place among Ibsenulls works"; Ibsen himself regarded Emperor and Galilean as his masterpiece.

Ibsen is often ranked as one of the most distinguished playwrights in the European tradition. He is widely regarded as the foremost playwright of the nineteenth century. He influenced other playwrights and novelists such as George Bernard Shaw, Oscar Wilde, Arthur Miller, James Joyce, Eugene OnullNeill, and Miroslav Krleža. Ibsen was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1902, 1903, and 1904.

Ibsen wrote his plays in Danish (the common written language of Denmark and Norway during his lifetime) and they were published by the Danish publisher Gyldendal. Although most of his plays are set in Norway—often in places reminiscent of Skien, the port town where he grew up—Ibsen lived for 27 years in Italy and Germany, and rarely visited Norway during his most productive years. Born into a patrician merchant family, the intertwined Ibsen and Paus family, Ibsen shaped his dramas according to his family background and often modeled characters after family members. He was the father of Prime Minister Sigurd Ibsen. Ibsenulls dramas had a strong influence upon contemporary culture.', dob = '1828-03-20', photo_url = 'https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/7dh8HZGcyATPbl563SJ0x1SVoef.jpg'

After spending the 1980s honing his comedy act and playing supporting roles in films, Carrey gained recognition when he was cast in the Fox sketch comedy series In Living Color (1990–1994). He broke out as a film star after starring in a string of box office hits, such as Ace Ventura: Pet Detective, The Mask, Dumb and Dumber (all 1994), Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls, and Batman Forever(both 1995). The success of these five films led to Carrey being the first comic actor to receive an upfront $20 million salary for performing in films, beginning with The Cable Guy (1996).

Carrey continued to have success as a leading actor in comedies such as Liar Liar (1997), How the Grinch Stole Christmas (2000), Bruce Almighty (2003), Lemony Snicketnulls A Series of Unfortunate Events (2004), and Yes Man (2008). Since the 2010s, Carrey appeared in fewer films, with notable works including Dumb and Dumber To (2014) and his role as Doctor Eggman in the Sonic the Hedgehog film series (2020–present).

Although typecast mainly as a comedic actor, Carrey had success in dramatic roles. His critically acclaimed performances include the title role in The Truman Show (1998) and Andy Kaufman in Man on the Moon (1999), for which he won Golden Globe Awards. He starred in the romantic drama film Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004), for which he was nominated for a BAFTA Award and another Golden Globe.

    SET biography = N'Angela Kerecz is an American born actress and writer. Originally from the small town of Waynesboro, MS, Angela was always very involved in the arts through years of dance, piano, and clarinet training. In high school, she enjoyed participating in the drama club and was director of the schoolnulls play during her senior year. Angela went on to attend the University of Southern Mississippi where she received a Bachelornulls Degree in Polymer Science and a minor in Chemistry. She then moved to Jackson, TN and worked as a paint chemist, pharmaceutical sales representative, and later became a licensed realtor. In 2009, she met Bobby Kerecz, who was the lead singer for Chippendales at the time. A relationship soon turned into a marriage to Bobby on 10-10-10 on the beach in Hawaii. Bobby, a true entertainer at heart, reawakened the performer side of Angela, and they began pursuing an acting career together. Angelanulls first gig was as a featured extra on the TV show, "Nashville", which films in Tennessee. Being on a big set was a stimulus for Angela to know this was what she wanted to pursue. She used her analytical skills to study the business and develop her acting. Angela began to get noticed, and was offered a featured spot in a scene with Arnold Schwarzenegger for the film, "Sabotage", and was featured in the opening scene of "Scary Movie 5". She was also given a recurring feature as a waitress for 23 episodes of "Nashville." On the set of "Last Vegas", she was given some personal advice by Morgan Freeman, one of her favorite actors and a fellow Mississippian, who told her, "Every job is your last one until you get the next one." Inspired to keep following her dreams and work hard, she soon began acting in several independent films, where she landed strong supporting and lead roles in films such as "Shark Exorcist", "Hope", "The Cellular Effect" and many more which would help her move to the next level in her acting. Recently, Angela was in LA working where she had a supporting role in the film "One More Round", which stars Kevin Sorbo, among others. Angela is a diverse actress who has been cast in roles ranging from lawyer, counselor, seductress, mom, to the lead as a female superhero in a web series. Angela also does occasional modeling and commercial work. Together with her husband, Bobby, they wrote and produced "Souls Collide" - a short which they filmed in 2013. "Souls Collide" also gave Angela the opportunity to put her directornulls hat back on, which she truly enjoyed. This project then became the launch pad to the screenplay they have just written, "S.O.U.L.", a bio-pic of how they met and struggles they have faced - a story of Searching, Obsessions, Understanding, and Love - a story of redemption. "S.O.U.L." is in pre-production, and Angela and Bobby will star as themselves in this very personal project.  - IMDb Mini Biography By: 7 Souls Productions', dob = null, photo_url = 'https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/9LSuUt7EePTEHlUD3VwERFEQkY2.jpg'

    SET biography = N'John Ronald Reuel Tolkien, CBE, was an English writer, poet, philologist, and university professor, best known as the author of the classic high-fantasy works The Hobbit, The Lord of the Rings, and The Silmarillion. He served as the Rawlinson and Bosworth Professor of Anglo-Saxon and Fellow of Pembroke College, Oxford, from 1925 to 1945 and Merton Professor of English Language and Literature and Fellow of Merton College, Oxford from 1945 to 1959. He was at one time a close friend of C. S. Lewis —they were both members of the informal literary discussion group known as the Inklings. Tolkien was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire by Queen Elizabeth II on 28 March 1972. After Tolkienulls death, his son Christopher published a series of works based on his fathernulls extensive notes and unpublished manuscripts, including The Silmarillion. These, together with The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings form a connected body of tales, poems, fictional histories, invented languages, and literary essays about a fantasy world called Arda, and Middle-Earth within it. Between 1951 and 1955, Tolkien applied the term “legendarium” to the larger part of these writings. While many other authors had published works of fantasy before Tolkien, the great success of The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings led directly to a popular resurgence of the genre. This has caused Tolkien to be popularly identified as the father of modern fantasy literature —or, more precisely, of high fantasy.  In 2008, The Times ranked him sixth on a list of The 50 greatest British writers since 1945.', dob = '1892-01-03', photo_url = 'https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/8AYNNfNuhpzPHxki7cBISG9JpGx.jpg'

Upon his college graduation, Reagan first moved to Iowa to work as a radio broadcaster and then in 1937 to Los Angeles, California. He began a career as an actor appearing in over fifty movie productions. Some of his most notable roles are in Knute Rockne, All American and Kings Row.

Reagan served as president of the Screen Actors Guild, and later spokesman for General Electric. His start in politics occurred during his work for General Electric.

    SET biography = N'Elvis Aaron Presley (January 8, 1935 – August 16, 1977), or simply Elvis, was an American singer and actor. Dubbed the "King of Rock and Roll", he is regarded as one of the most significant cultural figures of the 20th century. His energized interpretations of songs and sexually provocative performance style, combined with a singularly potent mix of influences across color lines during a transformative era in race relations, led him to both great success and initial controversy.

Presley was born in Tupelo, Mississippi, and relocated to Memphis, Tennessee, with his family when he was 13 years old. His music career began there in 1954, recording at Sun Records with producer Sam Phillips, who wanted to bring the sound of African-American music to a wider audience. Presley, on rhythm acoustic guitar, and accompanied by lead guitarist Scotty Moore and bassist Bill Black, was a pioneer of rockabilly, an uptempo, backbeat-driven fusion of country music and rhythm and blues. In 1955, drummer D. J. Fontana joined to complete the lineup of Presleynulls classic quartet and RCA Victor acquired his contract in a deal arranged by Colonel Tom Parker, who would manage him for more than two decades. Presleynulls first RCA Victor single, "Heartbreak Hotel", was released in January 1956 and became a number-one hit in the United States. Within a year, RCA would sell ten million Presley singles. With a series of successful network television appearances and chart-topping records, Presley became the leading figure of the newly popular sound of rock and roll, though his performative style and promotion of the then-marginalized sound of African-Americans led to him being widely considered a threat to the moral well-being of the White American youth.

In November 1956, Presley made his film debut in Love Me Tender. Drafted into military service in 1958, Presley relaunched his recording career two years later with some of his most commercially successful work. He held few concerts, however, and guided by Parker, proceeded to devote much of the 1960s to making Hollywood films and soundtrack albums, most of them critically derided. Some of his most famous films included Jailhouse Rock (1957), Blue Hawaii (1961), and Viva Las Vegas (1964). In 1968, following a seven-year break from live performances, he returned to the stage in the acclaimed television comeback special Elvis, which led to an extended Las Vegas concert residency and a string of highly profitable tours. In 1973, Presley gave the first concert by a solo artist to be broadcast around the world, Aloha from Hawaii. Years of prescription drug abuse and unhealthy eating habits severely compromised his health, and he died suddenly in 1977 at his Graceland estate at the age of 42.', dob = '1935-01-08', photo_url = 'https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/psf1wJUw48ALsfV3tN31FX0mDW5.jpg'

Along with fellow Beatle Paul McCartney, he formed one of the most successful songwriting partnerships of the 20th century.

Born and raised in Liverpool, Lennon became involved as a teenager in the skiffle craze; his first band, The Quarrymen, evolved into The Beatles in 1960. As the group disintegrated towards the end of the decade, Lennon embarked on a solo career that produced the critically acclaimed albums John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band and Imagine, and iconic songs such as "Give Peace a Chance" and "Imagine". Lennon disengaged himself from the music business in 1975 to devote time to his family, but re-emerged in 1980 with a new album, Double Fantasy. He was murdered by Mark Chapman three weeks after its release.

Lennon revealed a rebellious nature and acerbic wit in his music, his writing, his drawings, on film, and in interviews, and he became controversial through his political and peace activism. He moved to New York City in 1971, where his criticism of the Vietnam War resulted in a lengthy attempt by Richard Nixonulls administration to deport him, while his songs were adopted as anthems by the anti-war movement.

As of 2010, Lennonulls solo album sales in the United States exceed 14 million units, and as writer, co-writer or performer, he is responsible for 27 number-one singles on the US Hot 100 chart. In 2002, a BBC poll on the 100 Greatest Britons voted him eighth, and in 2008, Rolling Stone ranked him the fifth-greatest singer of all-time.

With a career that spanned nearly 80 years, Hope appeared in more than 70 short and feature films — 54 in which he starred. These included a series of seven Road to... musical comedy films with Bing Crosby as Hopenulls top-billed partner.

In addition to hosting the Academy Awards show 19 times, more than any other host, Hope appeared in many stage productions and television roles and wrote 14 books. The song "Thanks for the Memory" was his signature tune.

Hope was born in the Eltham district of southeast London. He arrived in the United States with his family at the age of four, and grew up near Cleveland, Ohio. After a brief stint in the late 1910s as a boxer, Hope began his career in show business in the early 1920s, initially as a comedian and dancer on the vaudeville circuit, before acting on Broadway. Hope began appearing on radio and in films starting in 1934. He was praised for his comedic timing, specializing in one-liners and rapid-fire delivery of jokes that were often self-deprecating. He helped establish modern American stand-up comedy.

Between 1941 and 1991, Hope made 57 tours for the United Service Organizations (USO), entertaining active duty U.S. military personnel around the world. In 1997, the United States Congress passed a bill that made Hope an honorary veteran of the U.S. Armed Forces. Hope appeared in numerous television specials for NBC during his career and was one of the first users of cue cards.

    SET biography = N'Jay Wolpert is an American television producer and screenwriter.

Wolpert began his game show producing career working for US quiz scandal figure Dan Enright in Canada. He later worked as a producer and creator of game shows for Chuck Barris Productions and Goodson-Todman Productions. While at Goodson-Todman, he served as producer of The Price is Right from 1972 until 1978.

Wolpert left Goodson-Todman to form his own production company. His first game show was the 1979 series Whew! for CBS. Whew! was canceled in 1980 and Wolpert didnullt return to television with a series until January 1983, despite shooting several pilots in the interim. On January 3, 1983, Wolpertnulls Hit Man debuted on NBC with Peter Tomarken. Like most of Wolpertnulls productions, Hit Man was short-lived and left the air after thirteen weeks.

Five years later, Wolpert returned to daytime television with the series Blackout for CBS. Debuting on January 4, 1988 in place of the long-running hit The $25,000 Pyramid, Blackout never found an audience as. The Bob Goen-hosted Blackout ended after thirteen weeks of episodes and was replaced by The $25,000 Pyramid.

In 1990 Wolpert launched a new series on the Lifetime network based on a pilot he had shot in 1981 with Tomarken as host. On February 5, 1990, Rodeo Drive debuted with comedienne Louise DuArt hosting. Again, however, Wolpert was behind a short lived series and Rodeo Drive ended its run on August 31 of that year; the show had only aired twelve weeks of new episodes prior to that and had been in reruns until the program was removed from Lifetimenulls lineup.

After a hiatus, Wolpert returned to the Goodson Productions team and produced a new Price is Right series for Goodson and Paramount Television. The New Price is Right debuted in syndication in September 1994, with Wolpert producing. But as with Wolpertnulls previous three series, ratings for The New Price is Right were lacking and it resulted in a cancellation after sixteen weeks in January 1995.

In 1996 Wolpert and The Family Channel teamed up for two series. One was Wait nulltil You Have Kids, another short-lived series based on The Parent Game, a series produced by Wolpertnulls previous employer Chuck Barris. The other was the popular Shopping Spree, which ran for nearly two years and was Wolpertnulls longest-running game show in his companynulls history. After Shopping Spree went off the air in August 1998, Wolpertnulls company stopped producing programming. He was executive producer of the 1998 version of Match Game. Despite having worked for Goodson during the 1970nulls, he didnullt work on the 1970nulls version of that show.

More recently, Wolpert has turned to screenwriting, writing the script for The Count of Monte Cristo (2002) and receiving a story credit for Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (2003).

In the 2010-11 season, Wolpert is listed as a consultant during the credits of Who Wants to be a Millionaire and had some input in that seasonulls format changes.

He also served as ILMnulls visual effects supervisor for Star Trek Generations and Star Trek: First Contact, as well as the Pirates of the Caribbean series. Along with Hal Hickel, Charles Gibson and Allen Hall, Knoll and the trionulls work on Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Manulls Chest earned them the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects.

Knoll has been praised by directors James Cameron, Gore Verbinski, Guillermo del Toro, and Brad Bird. Del Toro, who worked with Knoll for the first time on Pacific Rim, stated, "He basically has the heart of a kid and the mind of a scientist, and thatnulls a great combination."

Knoll was also the inventor of Knoll Light Factory, a lens flare-generating software inspired by his work at Industrial Light and Magic. He was the Computer Graphics Project Designer on The Abyss, an achievement which earned ILM its tenth Oscar, and worked on two Star Trek episodes: Star Trek: The Next Generationulls pilot episode ("Encounter at Farpoint") and the Star Trek: Deep Space Nine episode "Explorers".

John Knoll reflected on his work with George Lucas on the Star Wars prequel trilogy: "I still feel like I owe George a lot to have been given that opportunity. On those three films, I feel like I got a whole careernulls worth of experience packed into eight years. George never constricted his thinking to what he knew for sure the tools were capable of; his attitude was, "Yeah, well, Inullm writing what I want to see, so you guys will figure it out." I loved that he would constantly throw those challenges out with the confidence [that] you guys will figure it out. That was great."

In 2016, John Knoll and his brother Thomas were inducted into the International Photography Hall of Fame and Museum.

At the 2019 Oscars, John and his brother Thomas were awarded a Scientific and Engineering Award for the original architecture, design and development of Photoshop.

    SET biography = N'Hal T. Hickel is a visual effects animator for Industrial Light & Magic.

At the age of 12, Hickel wrote a letter to Lucasfilm, outlining his ideas for a sequel to the original Star Wars movie (now known as Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope), and received a polite rejection letter from producer Gary Kurtz.

Hickel began his animation career at Pixar in 1994, where he worked on Toy Story and the THXpromos, as well as some of Pixarnulls short films. Hearing that a new Star Wars trilogy was in pre-production, Hickel applied for a transfer to ILM on the chance that he might get to work on the prequels. He was first assigned as an animator on The Lost World: Jurassic Park, but was eventually assigned to work on The Phantom Menace, and later its sequel, Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones, where he was responsible for the unique movement of the Droideka destroyer droids.

His other credits include A.I. Artificial Intelligence, Space Cowboys, Dreamcatcher and Van Helsing. In 2007, Hickel won the BAFTA and the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects along with John Knoll, Charles Gibson and Allen Hall, for Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Manulls Chest. He also received an Academy Award nomination for his work on Rogue One: A Star Wars Story.

    SET biography = N'Rochelle Okoye is a world-renowned Hollywood stunt woman, actress, best-selling author, motivational speaker, and trauma-informed breath work facilitator certified through SOMA Breath. With a powerful blend of elite athleticism, academic excellence, and deep personal transformation, Rochelle has built a multifaceted career rooted in resilience and empowerment.

Born in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Rochelle began her gymnastics training at the age of two. At seven, her family relocated to the UK, where her father completed his PhD at Cambridge and Oxford Universities. By age 10, she was competing internationally for Great Britain, becoming the British National Gymnastics Champion in 1996-a title she held for three consecutive years. She was also twice nominated and awarded as Englandnulls Top Sports Person Under 13. At 14, the BBC produced a one-hour documentary titled Going for Gold, chronicling her pursuit of a spot on the 2000 Olympic team.

That dream was cut short when the International Gymnastics Federation (FIG) raised the age requirement for Olympic competition to 16-leaving Rochelle ineligible by just one year. This pivotal moment redirected the course of her athletic journey.

An academic high achiever, Rochelle skipped a grade and graduated from both high school and university a year early. She earned her B.Sc. in Psychology from the University of Northern British Columbia and went on to work with children and youth navigating developmental, cognitive, and behavioral challenges.

Driven by a lifelong desire to push physical and mental limits, Rochelle transitioned into martial arts-training and competing in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu and Muay Thai-she also embarked on a successful amateur and professional boxing career. In 2008, she made history as the first female boxer to compete in a professional fight in British Columbia. During this time, she also earned her diploma in personal training and later went on to become the co-founder of the acclaimed Tristar Vancouver Martial Arts gym.

Rochellenulls physical discipline seamlessly translated into a thriving career as a Hollywood stunt performer and actress. Having overcome a life marked by adversity, trauma, and profound personal challenges, she has immersed herself in various healing modalities to rise, reclaim her power, and give back. Today, she uses her platform to empower others through her best-selling book With Every Damn Brick, her powerful TEDx Talk How to Turn Your Pain Into Power, and her work as a motivational speaker and breath work facilitator. Her story is a testament to transformation, and she now dedicates her life to helping others do the same-teaching that no matter how heavy the past, it can be alchemized into strength, purpose, and impact.', dob = '1985-05-26', photo_url = 'https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/jeIYs0OoYFXIYuwFu1VXFR4SsmZ.jpg'

Miyazaki began his career at Toei Animation as an in-between artist for Gullivernulls Travels Beyond the Moon where he pitched his own ideas that eventually became the movienulls ending. He continued to work in various roles in the animation industry over the decade until he was able to direct his first feature film Lupin III: The Castle of Cagliostro which was published in 1979. After the success of his next film, Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind, he co-founded Studio Ghibli where he continued to produce many feature films until Princess Mononoke whereafter he temporarily retired.

While Miyazakinulls films have long enjoyed both commercial and critical success in Japan, he remained largely unknown to the West until Miramax released his 1997 film, Princess Mononoke. Princess Mononoke was the highest-grossing film in Japan—until it was eclipsed by another 1997 film, Titanic—and the first animated film to win Picture of the Year at the Japanese Academy Awards. Miyazaki returned to animation with Spirited Away. The film topped Titanicnulls sales at the Japanese box office, also won Picture of the Year at the Japanese Academy Awards and was the first anime film to win an American Academy Award.

Miyazakinulls films often incorporate recurrent themes, such as humanitynulls relationship to nature and technology, and the difficulty of maintaining a pacifist ethic. Reflecting Miyazakinulls feminism, the protagonists of his films are often strong, independent girls or young women. Miyazaki is a vocal critic of capitalism and globalization. While two of his films, The Castle of Cagliostro and Castle in the Sky, involve traditional villains, his other films such as Nausicaa or Princess Mononoke present morally ambiguous antagonists with redeeming qualities.', dob = '1941-01-05', photo_url = 'https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/ouhjt9KugzhWtdEyBPipihB3ic8.jpg'

    SET biography = N'Joseph Hill "Joss" Whedon (/ˈwiːdən/ WEE-dən; born June 23, 1964) is an American screenwriter, director, producer, comic book writer, and composer. He is best known as the creator of several television series: the supernatural drama Buffy the Vampire Slayer (1997–2003) and its spinoff Angel (1999–2004), the short-lived space Western Firefly (2002), the Internet musical miniseries Dr. Horriblenulls Sing-Along Blog (2008), the science fiction drama Dollhouse (2009–2010), the Marvel Cinematic Universe film The Avengers (2012) and series Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. (2013–2020), and the science fiction drama The Nevers (2021).

After beginning his career in sitcoms, Whedon wrote the poorly received horror comedy film Buffy the Vampire Slayer (1992)—which he later adapted into the acclaimed television series of the same name—co-wrote the Pixar animated film Toy Story (1995), and wrote the science fiction horror film Alien Resurrection (1997). After achieving success as a television showrunner, Whedon returned to film to write and direct the Firefly film continuation Serenity (2005), co-write and produce the horror comedy film The Cabin in the Woods (2012), and write and direct the Shakespeare adaptation Much Ado About Nothing (2012). For the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Whedon wrote and directed the ensemble superhero film The Avengers (2012) and its sequel Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015). He also co-wrote the DC Extended Universe superhero film Justice League (2017), for which he also served as director for reshoots, replacing Zack Snyder (who retained directorial credit).

Whedon has also worked as a composer (notably for the Buffy the Vampire Slayer musical episode "Once More, with Feeling" and Dr. Horriblenulls Sing-Along Blog) and comic book writer, both for comic book continuations of television series he created and for established franchises, such as Astonishing X-Men.

Beginning in July 2020, multiple actors, producers, and writers spoke out against Whedon following the toxic workplace environment he had allegedly created in many of his projects. Whedon has denied any wrongdoing, while acknowledging that he can be "confrontational."

    SET biography = N'Luca Vannella is an Emmy-nominated hairstylist. At just seventeen years old, he began his journey in hairstyling in central Rome, where he developed a deep appreciation for the imaginative and creative artistry of hairdressing. After two years of honing his craft in Italy, he relocated to London to study at the prestigious Toni & Guy Academy, graduating with the highest honours. His talent quickly propelled him to the role of Style Director at the Marylebone salon in Central London, before he eventually returned to Italy to pursue a career in the film industry.

Vannellanulls expertise and growing reputation earned him a wealth of high-profile film credits. Among his early notable works are Snow White and the Huntsman (2012) and Thor: The Dark World (2013), both of which garnered him recognition at the Premio Chioma di Berenice—he won Best Hair Design for Snow White and the Huntsman and earned a nomination for Thor: The Dark World. He expanded his portfolio with acclaimed blockbusters such as Thor: Ragnarok(2017), Avengers: Infinity War (2018), and Avengers: Endgame (2019), working as Hair Department Head or Personal Hairstylist for actors like Chris Hemsworth, Tom Hiddleston, and Mark Ruffalo. His collaborations also include Men in Black: International (2019), Extraction (2020) and Extraction 2 (2023), Stillwater (2021), and The Last Duel (2021), often serving as Hair Designer or Department Head.

In the realm of television, Vannella earned major recognition for his work on Penny Dreadful (2014). In 2017, he received nominations for both the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Hairstyling for a Single-Camera Series—specifically for the episode "Ebb Tide," which he shared with Alexis Continente, Sevlene Roddy, Joe Whelan, and Orla Carrol—and the Hollywood Makeup Artist and Hair Stylist Guild Award for Best Period and/or Character Hair Styling – Television and New Media Series, along with Alexis Continente.

More recently, Vannella was acknowledged for his outstanding hairstyling in the epic film Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga(2024). In 2025, he received the AACTA Award for Best Hair and Makeup along with Lesley Vanderwalt, Larry Van Duynhoven, and Matteo Silvi. That same year, he was also nominated by the Minnesota Film Critics Alliance for Best Makeup and Hairstyling, and the film had earlier been nominated at the Astra Creative Arts Awards in 2024 for Best Makeup and Hairstyling.', dob = null, photo_url = 'https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/3V95IInYtScu9PkCdc4YwHWP2SH.jpg'

    SET biography = N'Matthew Schmidt (born April 30, 1971) is an American film editor best known for working on several Marvel Cinematic Universe films, such as Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014), Captain America: Civil War (2016), Avengers: Infinity War (2018) and Avengers: Endgame (2019), all alongside Jeffrey Ford, Black Widow (2021), alongside Leigh Folsom Boyd, and Thor: Love and Thunder (2022), alongside Peter S. Elliot, Tim Roche and Jennifer Vecchiarello.

Schmidt first worked with Ford as an assistant editor, beginning with the first Avengers film and started sharing the editing credit with Ford, beginning with Captain America: The Winter Soldier. The duo edited Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame back-to-back, which was a two-year project and meant they were cutting at the same time of shooting. More than 900 hours of film were shot between both films, making the editing process a massive undertaking. Both films rank "among the biggest box-office earners of all time." For Avengers: Endgame, the two won the Saturn Award for Best Editing.

    SET biography = N'Trent Claus is a visual effects supervisor with Lola VFX. He is known for his work on the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), having contributed to 21 of their films.

Originally from Nebraska, he started his first job in a comic book store at the age of 13. In college, he obtained a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree from the University of Nebraska, Lincoln, and then entered the film industry as a matte painter.

Claus started his career as a matte painter, with work on such films as Iron Man, The Love Guru, and Jumper.

He then transitioned into compositing, working on such films as Blade Runner (The Final Cut), The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, Iron Man 2, and The Social Network. For his work on Captain America: The First Avenger, he was awarded the Visual Effects Society award for Outstanding Compositing in a Feature Motion Picture. In 2020 he was nominated for Outstanding Compositing once again for the film Captain Marvel.

As a visual effects supervisor, he has been responsible for most of the "aging" and "de-ageing" effects of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. In Avengers: Endgame, he supervised an estimated 200 age-manipulation shots, including characters played by Stan Lee and Michael Douglas, as well as Chris Evansnulls Captain America characternulls transformation into an old man. For the film Captain Marvel, he de-aged Samuel L. Jacksonulls character 25 years for the entire length of the film. He de-aged Michael Douglasnulls character Hank Pym in multiple films, including Ant-Man and Ant-Man and the Wasp (along with Laurence Fishburne and Michelle Pfeiffer).

For the film Avengers: Age of Ultron, Claus developed the look and design of the character Vision (played by Paul Bettany), from the plates and layers that make up Visionulls face, to the mechanical diaphragms in his eyes. He revisited the character again in the film Captain America: Civil War, delivering over 200 shots, 80 of which were Vision.

In 2019, he became a member of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.

    SET biography = N'Brendan Seals is a visual effects supervisor at Luma Pictures, originally from Australia, currently based in Melbourne. He holds a Bachelor of Arts from Curtin University (graduated in 2007), where his fascination with visual storytelling began with classic films such as E.T. and Jaws. His early experiments with filmmaking included staging lightsaber battles with friends, long before he entered the professional VFX arena.

Sealsnulls career path took shape when he joined the industry via Perth post-production house Boogie Monster, under the mentorship of Steve Vojkovic. There, he gained foundational experience in animation, lighting, and compositing. His trajectory soon led him to Luma Pictures in Melbourne, where he became a key creative force in their visual effects work.

Over the years, Seals has contributed to an impressive list of high-profile feature films. He began as a lighter and compositor on projects such as Thor: The Dark World (2013) and Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014), progressed to lighting supervisor on Guardians of the Galaxy (2014), and then to sequence supervisor on Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015) and Captain America: Civil War (2016). His credits later include serving as visual effects supervisor on Doctor Strange (2016), Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017), Thor: Ragnarok (2017), Black Panther (2018), Ant-Man and the Wasp (2018), Captain Marvel (2019), Spider-Man: Far From Home (2019), and Spider-Man: No Way Home (2021).

At the Visual Effects Society Awards, Seals was nominated for Outstanding Created Environment in a Photoreal Feature for Doctor Strange (2016). The same film also brought him a nomination at the AACTA Awards for Best Visual Effects or Animation. He followed this with another AACTA nomination for Black Panther (2018). That year, his work on Spider-Man: Far From Home (2019) earned him both a Saturn Award nomination for Best Special Effects from the Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy & Horror Films and an AACTA nomination—and indeed a win—for Best Visual Effects or Animation. He continued this streak with an AACTA nomination for Spider-Man: No Way Home (2021). Additionally, his role in the Coca‑Cola commercial A Mini Marvel (2016) secured a nomination for Outstanding Visual Effects in a Commercial at the VES Awards.

Beyond film, Brendan Seals has led the Melbourne VFX team at Luma Pictures on projects like Amazonulls The Tomorrow War (2021), tackling intricate creature design, extensive environment creation, and time-travel sequences with creativity and technical finesse. His background in design, FX, lighting, and compositing has also made him a featured guest at industry forums discussing the evolving landscape of VFX, including the rise of real-time effects and LED StageCraft technologies.', dob = null, photo_url = null

    SET biography = N'Martin Ivanov (born March 18, 1977) is a stunt driver and performer. Born in Moscow, then part of the RSFSR in the USSR. His full name is Martin Viktorovich Ivanov. He is the son of the veteran Russian stunt coordinator, actor, and director Viktor Ivanov.

Raised initially in Moscow, Ivanov later moved with his mother to Lithuania following his parents’ divorce. In his teens, he developed a passion for motorsport—by age 19, he had earned national titles in hippodrome and ring racing in Lithuania, and he continued to compete in rally championships in the region afterwards.

His entry into stunt performance came via his father’s invitation to work on the Russian film White Gold (2000), which sparked his interest in filmmaking and stunt work. A pivotal moment came in 2003 when director Paul Greengrass was filming The Bourne Supremacy (2004). There was a casting call in Moscow for a stunt double. Martin, whose physical resemblance to Matt Damon was striking, was selected to perform many of the dangerous action sequences without CGI. This daring work won praise—though the Taurus Award for that sequence went to his father because Martin was unable to secure a U.S. visa at the time.

From that breakthrough, Martin Ivanov became a sought-after stunt performer in Hollywood. He served as a stunt double in The Bourne Supremacy (2004), Quantum of Solace (2008), and Black Widow (2021), with credits also as a stunt driver or stunt performer in films like Fast & Furious 6 (2013), Jurassic World Dominion (2022), and Hardcore Henry (2015). Additionally, he appeared on-screen in Skyfall (2012) as a fruit seller in the Istanbul opening sequence. He played key roles in high-intensity car chase scenes—such as navigating the Aston Martin through tunnels and quarries in Quantum of Solace and executing complex sequences involving Coca-Cola-sprayed streets in No Time to Die (2021).

Over the years, Ivanov has earned considerable recognition for his work. He has collected nine wins and eight nominations across two major awards bodies: the Screen Actors Guild (SAG) Awards and the Taurus World Stunt Awards. Among the SAG Awards, he was a nominee in 2024 for Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny (2023), a winner in 2022 for No Time to Die (2021), a winner in 2021 for Wonder Woman 1984 (2020), and a nominee in earlier years for Black Widow (2021), Jason Bourne (2016), and Fast & Furious 6 (2013). His Taurus World Stunt Awards include a 2024 win for Best Speciality Stunt on Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny (2023), recognised for a spectacular Glasgow sequence featuring no CGI, involving horses, motorcycles, and intricate chase choreography. He also won in 2022 for Best Work with a Vehicle on No Time to Die (2021) and in prior years for films such as Jason Bourne (2016).', dob = '1977-03-18', photo_url = 'https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/fTYcCl9U3ak8j7qfGAeF5q8O5I6.jpg'

After graduating from high school and being accepted into USCnulls film production program, SWS hired Schiff back to do tech support as their systems administrator.

Itnulls a place where you can wear as many hats as you want to fit on your head, and one of Schiffnulls favourite "not in my job description" tasks he volunteered for was to help solder multicolour LEDs into and then assemble a robot head for A.I. - Artificial Intelligence. 

During college, though, Schiff got bit by the editing bug. He found that, even more than creature or visual effects, Schiff loved sitting in the editing bay for hours on end putting his student films together. So a year after college, and five years after starting his job at Stan Winstonulls, Schiff left to pursue editing full-time. It was slow at first, but through some family connections, friends he made at SWS, and a bit of luck, Schiff got his first few jobs as an assistant editor, and things have taken off from there.

Born and raised in New York City, Lane made her screen debut at age 14 in George Roy Hillnulls 1979 film A Little Romance. Laurence Olivier, who played a major supporting role in the film, called her "the new Grace Kelly".

The two films that could have catapulted her to star status, Streets of Fire and The Cotton Club, were both commercial and critical failures, and her career languished as a result. After taking a break, Lane returned to acting to appear in The Big Town and Lady Beware, but did not make another big impression on a sizable audience until 1989nulls popular and critically acclaimed TV miniseries Lonesome Dove, for which she was nominated for an Emmy Award. It was not until 1999 that Lane earned further recognition for her role in A Walk on the Moon, and that was followed by her performance alongside George Clooney and Mark Wahlberg in the 2000 blockbuster The Perfect Storm.

She was especially lauded and honored for the 2002 film Unfaithful, which earned her Satellite, New York Film Critics Circle, and National Society of Film Critics awards for Best Actress in a Motion Picture (Drama). Her performance in Unfaithful also garnered her Academy Award, Golden Globe, and Screen Actors Guild Award nominations for Best Actress. She was also highly lauded by critics for her performance in the immediately subsequent film Under the Tuscan Sun. For much of the rest of the decade, she alternately appeared as a lead actress in romantic films such as Must Love Dogs (2005) and Nights in Rodanthe (2008), and thrillers such as Fierce People (2005), Hollywoodland (2006), and Untraceable (2008).

    SET biography = N'Christopher Nolan (born 30 July 1970) is a British-American filmmaker whose concept-driven epics have reshaped the modern studio blockbuster. Renowned for structurally intricate storytelling, large-format cinematography, and practical effects, he is widely regarded as a defining director of the 21st century. His films have grossed over $6.6 billion worldwide and earned him two Academy Awards, two BAFTAs, and a Golden Globe. He was appointed CBE in 2019 and knighted in 2024 for services to film.

Raised between London and Evanston, Illinois, Nolan began making Super 8 shorts as a child, later studying English literature at University College London, where he ran the Film Society and met his producer and future wife, Emma Thomas; together they founded Syncopy Inc. After shorts like Doodlebug, he self-financed his micro-budget debut Following (1998), then broke through with the reverse-told amnesia noir Memento (2000). Studio work followed with Insomnia (2002) and then Batman Begins (2005), which launched a grounded superhero trilogy completed by The Dark Knight (2008) and The Dark Knight Rises (2012). Between and after those, he mounted original tentpoles—The Prestige (2006), Inception (2010), Interstellar (2014), and the triptych survival drama Dunkirk (2017), which earned his first Best Director nomination.

Nolan’s films interrogate time, memory, identity, ethics, and knowledge—sneaking metaphysics into genre frames (noir, heist, war, biopic). Hallmarks include nonlinear or braided timelines, precision cross-cutting, mathematically inflected imagery, practical/in-camera spectacle augmented by visual effects, experimental soundscapes, and a steadfast preference for celluloid (65mm/IMAX) and theatrical exhibition. A frequent collaborator with Jonathan Nolan (co-writer), Emma Thomas (producer), and craftspeople such as Wally Pfister, Hoyte van Hoytema, Lee Smith, and Hans Zimmer, he also advocates globally for film preservation and exhibition, curating restorations and convening archivists to champion photochemical cinema.

After the time-bending espionage of Tenet (2020), Nolan departed Warner Bros. and partnered with Universal on Oppenheimer (2023), a morally dense biopic that won him the Academy Awards for Best Director and Best Picture. He is re-teaming with Universal on The Odyssey (scheduled for 2026), an IMAX-shot adaptation of Homer’s epic. In 2025 he was elected President of the Directors Guild of America. Nolan lives in Los Angeles with Thomas and their four children, continuing to pair popular spectacle with intellectual ambition while championing the artistry—and communal ritual—of seeing movies on film, in cinemas.', dob = '1970-07-30', photo_url = 'https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/xuAIuYSmsUzKlUMBFGVZaWsY3DZ.jpg'

Nelle was born and raised in Paris, France. He began training in martial arts at 16, focusing on Taekwondo, where he developed the remarkable vertical jump that would become one of his signature strengths. He went on to teach Taekwondo for over a decade.

At 19, Cali expanded his movement repertoire by exploring street dance styles such as body popping, locking, and breakdancing. However, in 2006, a knee injury ended his competitive Taekwondo career.

In 2007, he relocated to London and discovered a passion for parkour. His unique fusion of freerunning and dance quickly caught the attention of directors and choreographers, leading to roles in short films, commercials, and music videos. He competed in the 2008 Barclaycard World Freerun Championships, where his performance stood out for its heavy incorporation of dance. The following year, he served as a judge for the competition.

Later in 2009, Cali and several friends departed from Urban Freeflow to form their team, Storm Freerun, which became known for pushing the boundaries of movement artistry.

Combining martial arts, parkour, freerunning, acrobatics, and performance, Cali naturally transitioned into stunt work.', dob = null, photo_url = 'https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/9JsBGeqfSe0Hugz9IWdkUUGIhhL.jpg'

As a wrestler, he has been signed to WWE since 2001 and is a record 17-time world champion as recognized by WWE. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest professional wrestlers ever.

Cena moved to California in 1998 to pursue a bodybuilding career and switched to professional wrestling in 1999, making his debut for Ultimate Pro Wrestling (UPW). In 2001, he signed with WWE (then WWF). He was assigned to its developmental territory, Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW), where he won the OVW Heavyweight Championship and OVW Southern Tag Team Championship. After moving up to WWEnulls main roster on SmackDown in 2002, he became a breakout success after adopting the character of a villainous trash-talking rapper. After winning his first WWE Championship in 2005, he underwent a gimmick change into a heroic character, which he described as a "goody-two shoes Superman". Cena led the company as its franchise player and public face from the mid-2000s to the mid-2010s. His face run from 2003 to 2025 is the longest in the history of WWE.

Cena has held the WWE Championship 13 times and the World Heavyweight Championship three times. He is also a five-time WWE United States Champion, a two-time WWE Tag Team Champion, a two-time World Tag Team Champion, a two-time Royal Rumble winner, and a one-time Money in the Bank winner. He has headlined multiple major WWE pay-per-views, including its flagship event WrestleMania six times (22, 23, 27, 28, 29 and 41). His career has been met with mixed critical and audience reception, with praise for his character work and promotional skills but criticism for his perceived over-representation and on-screen dominance relative to other wrestlers.

Cenanulls first starring film role was in The Marine (2006), and he gained praise for his performances in Trainwreck (2015), Ferdinand (2017), Blockers (2018), and Bumblebee (2018). He starred in F9 (2021) and Fast X (2023) and portrayed Peacemaker in The Suicide Squad (2021) and the eponymous television series (2022–present). He released his only studio album, You Canullt See Me, in 2005, which peaked at number 15 on the Billboard 200. Outside of his work in entertainment, Cena is known for his involvement in charitable causes and has granted the most wishes for the Make-A-Wish Foundation at over 650.

    SET biography = N'Milton "Bill" Finger (February 8, 1914–c. January 18, 1974) was an American comic book writer who was the co-creator (with Bob Kane) of the DC Comics character Batman. Despite making major (sometimes, signature) contributions as an innovative writer, visionary mythos/world builder, and illustration architect, Finger (like other creators of his era) was often relegated to ghostwriter status on many comics—including those featuring Batman and the original Green Lantern, Alan Scott.

While Kane privately admitted in a 1980s audio interview with his autobiographer that Finger was responsible for "50–75% of all the creativity in Batman," he publicly denied Finger had been anything more than a subcontractor executing Kanenulls ideas for decades. As a result, Finger died in obscurity and poverty while the Batman brand, and Kane, amassed international fame and wealth. In the 2000s, Finger biographer Marc Tyler Noblemanulls research uncovered previously unknown heirs. At the urging of Nobleman, the online comics fan community, and others, Fingernulls granddaughter revived the fight to restore his lost legacy, which continued for years. In 2015, DC Comicsnulls parent company conditionally agreed to recognise Fingernulls intellectual property claim as co-creator of the Batman characters and mythos, officially adding his name, going forward, to the "created by" credit line Kane had been contractually guaranteed in 1939.

By age 13 he was scripting and drawing original comic books. Ten years later? He was hired by Marvel Comics to illustrate Marvelnulls central characters in the comic book event, Marvels (1994).

Having established himself creatively and financially with superhero projects, Ross turned to the real world with Uncle Sam, a 96-page story that took a hard look at the dark side of American history. Like Marvels, the individual issues of Uncle Sam were collected into a single volume - first in hardcover, then in paperback - and remain in print today. Ross would eventually go on to win the Comic Buyernulls Guide Award for Favorite Painter. He won so many times that the award was officially retired.

Alexnulls work has celebrated the 60th anniversaries of Superman, Batman, Captain Marvel and Wonder Woman with fully painted, tabloid-sized books, depicting each of these characters using their powers to inspire humanity as well as help them.

In recent years, Ross has applied his artistic skills to outside projects with comic book roots, including a limited-edition promotional poster for the Academy Awards. In 2015, Alex was chosen by Apple Corps LTD to be commissioned as the first artist in over 30 years to paint the Fab Four. Driven by the Beatles legendary music and inspired by the generationulls new trends in art, "Yellow Submarine" is a classic of animated cinema. Alex has often been referred to as nullthe Norman Rockwell of comicsnull yet his "Yellow Submarine" piece reveals the similarly powerful influence of master surrealist Salvador Dali, whom Alex has also recognized as a guiding influence on his style.

    SET biography = N'Dame Judith Olivia "Judi" Dench, CH, DBE, FRSA (born 9 December 1934) is an English film, stage and television actress.

Dench made her professional debut in 1957 with the Old Vic Company. Over the following few years she played in several of William Shakespearenulls plays in such roles as Ophelia in Hamlet, Juliet in Romeo and Juliet and Lady Macbeth in Macbeth. She branched into film work, and won a BAFTA Award as Most Promising Newcomer; however, most of her work during this period was in theatre. Not generally known as a singer, she drew strong reviews for her leading role in the musical Cabaret in 1968.

During the next two decades, she established herself as one of the most significant British theatre performers, working for the National Theatre Company and the Royal Shakespeare Company. In television, she achieved success during this period, in the series A Fine Romance from 1981 until 1984 and in 1992 began a continuing role in the television romantic comedy series As Time Goes By.

Her film appearances were infrequent until she was cast as M in GoldenEye (1995), a role she played in each James Bond film until Skyfall (2012).

    SET biography = N'Ian Lancaster Fleming (28 May 1908 – 12 August 1964) was a British writer, best known for his postwar James Bond series of spy novels. Fleming came from a wealthy family connected to the merchant bank Robert Fleming & Co., and his father was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Henley from 1910 until his death on the Western Front in 1917. Educated at Eton, Sandhurst, and, briefly, the universities of Munich and Geneva, Fleming moved through several jobs before he started writing.

While working for Britainulls Naval Intelligence Division during the Second World War, Fleming was involved in planning Operation Goldeneye and in the planning and oversight of two intelligence units: 30 Assault Unit and T-Force. He drew from his wartime service and his career as a journalist for much of the background, detail, and depth of his James Bond novels.

Fleming wrote his first Bond novel, Casino Royale, in 1952, at age 44. It was a success, and three print runs were commissioned to meet the demand. Eleven Bond novels and two collections of short stories followed between 1953 and 1966. The novels centre around James Bond, an officer in the Secret Intelligence Service, commonly known as MI6. Bond is also known by his code number, 007, and was a commander in the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve. The Bond stories rank among the best-selling series of fictional books of all time, having sold over 100 million copies worldwide. Fleming also wrote the childrenulls story Chitty-Chitty-Bang-Bang (1964) and two works of non-fiction. In 2008, The Times ranked Fleming 14th on its list of "The 50 greatest British writers since 1945".

Fleming was married to Anne Charteris. She had divorced her husband, the 2nd Viscount Rothermere, because of her affair with the author. Fleming and Charteris had a son, Caspar. Fleming was a heavy smoker and drinker for most of his life and succumbed to heart disease in 1964 at the age of 56. Two of his James Bond books were published posthumously; other writers have since produced Bond novels. Flemingnulls creation has appeared in film twenty-seven times, portrayed by six actors in the official film series.

    SET biography = N'Peter Field is a second unit director of photography. He began his career in the visual effects department at Pinewood Studios, where he notably contributed to the production of Superman III. From those early days in optical and visual effects, he advanced into camera work both as an operator and as a second‑unit cinematographer, eventually building a reputation on large-scale international feature films and television productions.

Over the years, he has accumulated over 50 film credits and around 18 television credits, working across main, second, splinter, VFX, action, and model/miniature units. His roles frequently include second‑unit Director of Photography or camera operator, particularly on action sequences and specialised shots.

His cinematography collaborations span many high-profile films. Some examples include second‑unit work on Hot Fuzz (2007), Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001), Doomsday (2008), Edge of Tomorrow (2014), Spectre and Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation (both 2015), Jason Bourne (2016), Rogue One: A Star Wars Story (2016), Doctor Strange (2016), Mortal Engines (2018), The Huntsman: Winternulls War (2016), Maleficent: Mistress of Evil (2019), The Warrior Queen of Jhansi (2019), Kingdoms of Fire (2019), The Letter to the King (2020), The Wilds (2020) and The Lord of the Rings: Rings of Power seasons 1 and 2 (2022–2023).

In particular, his work as second‑unit Action/Drama Director of Photography on The Lord of the Rings: Rings of Power season 1 earned him the prestigious New Zealand Cinematographers Society Silver Award in May 2023. He was accorded full NZCS accreditation soon after. He then returned to shoot season 2 under the guidance of Vic Armstrong, his frequent collaborator, across a nine‑month UK shoot that concluded in mid‑2023.

Beyond films and episodic TV, Peter also works on commercials and short films, and enjoys operating additional units, including model/miniature units, as well as splinter and VFX units. He has collaborated with top directors such as Tim Burton, Joe Johnston, Neil Marshall, John Madden, Edgar Wright, Paul Greengrass, Sam Mendes, and Kenneth Branagh, as well as with major studios including Disney, Warner Bros., Marvel, Paramount, Netflix, Amazon Studios, MGM, Sony, Working Title, and more.

Lung Sihung (born 1930 – May 2, 2002), also romanized Lang Sihung, was an actor in the cinema of Taiwan who appeared in over 100 films and was best known for playing paternal roles in films including The Wedding Banquet and Eat Drink Man Woman. He frequently collaborated in the later years of his career with award-winning director Ang Lee, notably cast in films such as Pushing Hands and Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.

Lung enlisted in Chiang Kai-sheknulls army as a teenager to fight the Chinese Communist Party. After they seized control of mainland China, he escaped to Taiwan, where he was selected to join an army-sponsored acting troupe. Acting later became his career. His experience playing an array of roles for the army troupe later led his being cast in over 100 Chinese-language films and in Taiwanese soap operas, typically playing criminals or tough guys.

He had already retired from films when Ang Lee began casting for his first full-length film, 1992nulls Pushing Hands, and the director, who recalled watching Mr. Lung as a child, asked him to play a father in the film. Lungnulls sensitive portrayal of an elderly man faced with change turned him into an international star and he became famous for playing fathers struggling with modernity and adult children in the movies known to some fans as the Father Knows Best trilogy.

By the time he appeared as "Sir Te," guardian of a mystical sword in Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, Lungnulls health had deteriorated due to diabetes. He died of liver failure in 2002 at the age of 72.

    SET biography = N'Teri Ann Garr (December 11, 1944 – October 29, 2024) was an American actress, dancer and singer. She frequently appeared in comedic roles throughout her career, which spanned four decades and includes over 140 credits in film and television. Her accolades include one Academy Award nomination, a BAFTA Award nomination, and one National Board of Review Award.

Born in Lakewood, Ohio, Garr was raised in North Hollywood. She was the third child of a comedic-actor father and a studio costumer mother. In her youth, Garr trained in ballet and other forms of dance. She began her career as a teenager with small roles in television and film in the early 1960s, including appearances as a dancer in six Elvis Presley musicals. After spending two years attending college, Garr left Los Angeles and studied acting at the Lee Strasberg Institute in New York City.

Her self-described "big break" as an actress was landing a role in the Star Trek episode "Assignment: Earth," after which she said, "I finally started to get real acting work."

Garr had a supporting role in Francis Ford Coppolanulls thriller "The Conversation" (1974) before having her film breakthrough as Inga in "Young Frankenstein" (1974). In 1977, she was cast in a high-profile role in Steven Spielbergnulls "Close Encounters of the Third Kind." Garr continued to appear in various high-profile roles throughout the 1980s, including supporting parts in the comedies "Tootsie" (1982), for which she was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her role of Sandra Lester, and then appearing opposite Michael Keaton the next year in "Mr. Mom" (1983). She reunited with Coppola the same year, appearing in his musical "One from the Heart" (1982), followed by a supporting part in Martin Scorsesenulls black comedy "After Hours" (1985).

Her quick banter led to Garr being a regular guest on "The Tonight Show" starring Johnny Carson and "Late Night with David Letterman." In the 1990s, she appeared in two films by Robert Altman: "The Player" (1992) and "Prêt-à-Porter" (1994), followed by supporting roles in "Michael" (1996) and "Ghost World" (2001). She also appeared on television as Phoebe Abbott in three episodes of the sitcom "Friends" (1997–98). In 2002, Garr announced that she had been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, the symptoms of which had negatively affected her ability to perform beginning in the 1990s. After years of declining health, she passed away on October 29, 2024.', dob = '1944-12-11', photo_url = 'https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/iscVncnCVtM8Wl4FmcEkr6KDtRE.jpg'

    SET biography = N'Todd Harry Rundgren (born June 22, 1948) is an American multi-instrumentalist, singer, songwriter, and record producer who has performed a diverse range of styles as a solo artist and as a member of the band Utopia. He is known for his sophisticated and often unorthodox music, his occasionally lavish stage shows, and his later experiments with interactive entertainment. He also produced music videos and was an early adopter and promoter of various computer technologies, such as using the Internet as a means of music distribution in the late 1990s.

A native of Philadelphia, Rundgren began his professional career in the mid 1960s, forming the psychedelic band Nazz in 1967. Two years later, he left Nazz to pursue a solo career and immediately scored his first US top 40 hit with "We Gotta Get You a Woman" (1970). His best-known songs include "Hello Itnulls Me" and "I Saw the Light" from Something/Anything? (1972), which get frequent air time on classic rock radio stations, and the 1983 single "Bang the Drum All Day", which is featured in many sports arenas, commercials, and movie trailers. Although lesser known, "Couldnullt I Just Tell You" (1972) was influential to many artists in the power pop genre. His 1973 album A Wizard, a True Star remains an influence on later generations of bedroom musicians.

Rundgren is considered a pioneer in the fields of electronic music, progressive rock, music videos, computer software, and Internet music delivery. He organized the first interactive television concert in 1978, designed the first color graphics tablet in 1980, and created the first interactive album, No World Order, in 1994.[1][5] Additionally, he was one of the first acts to be prominent as both an artist and producer. His notable production credits include Badfingernulls Straight Up (1971), Grand Funk Railroadnulls Wenullre an American Band (1973), the New York Dollsnull New York Dolls (1973), Meat Loafnulls Bat Out of Hell (1977) and XTCnulls Skylarking (1986).', dob = '1948-06-22', photo_url = 'https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/3qhnYvkPa1xKtURYzcFLE20Jg49.jpg'

    SET biography = N'Bob Simmons (Fulham, London, England, 31 March 1923 – 21 October 1987) was an English actor and stunt man who worked in many British-made films, most notably the James Bond series.

Simmons was a former Army Physical Training Instructor at Royal Military Academy Sandhurst who had initially planned to be an actor but thought a career in performing stunts would be more lucrative and interesting. Simmons first worked for Albert R. Broccoli and Irving Allenulls Warwick Films on the film The Red Beret, which included future Bond film regulars director Terence Young, screenwriter Richard Maibaum and cameraman, later director of photography Ted Moore. Simmons later worked in many other Warwick Films and worked for Allen in his The Long Ships and Genghis Khan, where he had his eye injured when kicked by a horse.

When Albert R. Broccoli began to produce the James Bond films, Simmons tested as an actor for the Bond role, but until his death in 1987, he became the stunt coordinator for every Bond film except From Russia with Love, which he joined later in the production, On Her Majestynulls Secret Service and The Man with the Golden Gun. He appeared in the gun barrel sequence for Sean Connery in three James Bond films: Dr. No, From Russia with Love, and Goldfinger. Simmons is the only person to officially perform the scene, while not starring in the main role of James Bond. Simmons was also Connerynulls stunt double. Simmons also had a role as SPECTRE agent Jacques Bouvar in the pre-title sequence of the fourth film, Thunderball.

Simmons developed a stunt technique involving trampolines, first used in You Only Live Twice, whereby stuntmen would bounce off a trampoline in concert with a triggered explosion so as to simulate being blown into the air. This was used in many other films, including by Simmons again in The Wild Geese, where Simmons also doubled for Richard Burton.

Upon retirement, Simmons wrote an autobiography entitled Nobody Does It Better titled after the theme song for the 1977 Bond film The Spy Who Loved Me. He died on 21 October 1987.', dob = '1922-03-31', photo_url = 'https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/r8FFHcp0a9VNCpR14S22SNIzLBK.jpg'

Maibaum attended New York University, then studied acting at the University of Iowa. By the time he was in his late twenties, Maibaum was a well established Broadway actor and playwright. He entered films as a screenwriter in 1937, spending the war years with the armynulls Combat Film Division. In 1946, he joined Paramount as both screenwriter and producer, contributing to such films as The Big Clock (1948) and The Great Gatsby (1949).

From advice that making films abroad was an excellent tax shelter, Maibaum formed a partnership in the 1950s with producers Irving Allen and Albert R. Broccoli This led to his involvement in the phenomenally successful James Bond series of the 1960s and 1970s and, after Ian Fleming, Maibaum has arguably been the person most responsible for shaping the image of the screenulls most famous spy!', dob = '1909-05-26', photo_url = 'https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/sqjcu780KEimvNeCaliaVLmth64.jpg'

    SET biography = N'Herschel "Harry" Saltzman (October 27, 1915 – September 28, 1994) was a Canadian theatre and film producer. He is best remembered for co-producing the first nine of the James Bond film series with Albert R. Broccoli. He lived most of his life in Denham, Buckinghamshire, England.

Saltzman was born in a hospital in Sherbrooke, Quebec, the son of Jewish immigrants Abraham Saltzman and Dora Horstein. He was raised in Saint John, New Brunswick for the first seven years of his life. His father, a horticulturalist, immigrated to the US in 1905 from Kozienice, Poland (then the Russian Empire), marrying Dora in 1909. The couple moved to Canada in 1910 where their four oldest children (Minnie, Florence, Harry and Isadore) were born, before moving the family to Cleveland, Ohio where their youngest son, David, was born. Harry ran away from home at the age of 15. Saltzman was 30 when he learned where he had actually been born.

At about age 17, Saltzman joined a circus and travelled with them for some years.

In 1932, Saltzman moved to Paris to study political science and economics. However within a year, he was "hand-picking talent for 40 two-a-day vaudeville houses all over Europe." Saltzman claimed that he had worked as an assistant for French film director René Clair, who came to the United States in 1940 to make the film The Flame of New Orleans.

In 1942, Saltzman signed a booking contract with Fanchon & Marco Enterprises. Saltzman went to the West Coast to sign big picture names. Saltzman sought the Ritz Brothers, but due to film commitments, they could not sign. In 1943, Saltzman was managing The Gilbert Brothersnull Combined Circus. According to an advert, the 1943 season began 26 May in Clifton, New Jersey, and was booked solid through the Eastern American states until mid-October.

Shortly after World War II began, he enlisted with the Royal Canadian Air Force in Vancouver. He received a medical discharge in Trenton, Ontario in 1943, and joined the U.S. Psychological Warfare Bureau, because he wanted to get back to Europe. Saltzmann was initially stationed at the North African theatre in 1943 before being reassigned to London.

In 1945, Saltzman helped Lin Yutang establish UNESCOnulls film division, which was initially focused on trying to mediate the Chinese Civil War between the Communist Party and the Kuomintang. He eventually quit due to "east-west differences" which to him seemed "so hopeless". Saltzman spent a year with the French governmentnulls Ministry of Reconstruction. At that point, he decided he wanted back in show business. ...

    SET biography = N'John Barry Prendergast OBE (3 November 1933 – 30 January 2011) was an English composer and conductor of film music.

He composed the scores for eleven of the James Bond films between 1963 and 1987, as well as arranging and performing the "James Bond Theme" for the first film in the series, 1962nulls Dr. No. He wrote the Grammy- and Academy Award-winning scores to the films Dances with Wolves and Out of Africa, as well as the scores of The Scarlet Letter; Chaplin; The Cotton Club; The Tamarind Seed; Mary, Queen of Scots; Game of Death; and the theme for the television series The Persuaders!, in a career spanning over 50 years. In 1999, he was appointed with an OBE for services to music.

Born in York, Barry spent his early years working in cinemas owned by his father. During his national service with the British Army in Cyprus, Barry began performing as a musician after learning to play the trumpet. Upon completing his national service, he formed a band in 1957, the John Barry Seven. He later developed an interest in composing and arranging music, making his début for television in 1958. He came to the notice of the makers of the first James Bond film Dr. No, who were dissatisfied with a theme for James Bond given to them by Monty Norman. Noel Rogers, the head of music at United Artists, approached Barry. This started a successful association between Barry and the Bond series that lasted for 25 years.

Barry received awards including five Academy Awards: two for Born Free and one each for The Lion in Winter (for which he also won the first BAFTA Award for Best Film Music), Dances with Wolves and Out of Africa (both of which also won him Grammy Awards). He also received ten Golden Globe Award nominations, winning once for Best Original Score for Out of Africa in 1986. Barry completed his last film score, Enigma, in 2001 and recorded the successful album Eternal Echoes the same year. He then concentrated chiefly on live performances and co-wrote the music to the musical Brighton Rock in 2004 alongside Don Black.

In 2001, Barry became a Fellow of the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors, and, in 2005, he was made a Fellow of the British Academy of Film and Television Arts. Barry was married four times and had four children. He moved to the United States in 1975 and lived there until his death in 2011.

    SET biography = N'Maurice Binder (December 4, 1918 – April 9, 1991) was an American film title designer best known for his work on 16 James Bond films including the first, Dr. No (1962) and for Stanley Donenulls films from 1958.

He was born in New York City, but mostly worked in Britain from the 1950s onwards. In 1951, Binder directed two short films in the obscure Meet Mister Baby series; these films were preserved by the Academy Film Archive in 2015. He did his first film title design for Stanley Donenulls Indiscreet (1958). The Bond producers first approached him after being impressed by his title designs for the Donen comedy film The Grass Is Greener (1960). Binder also provided sequences for Donen for Charade (1963) and Arabesque (1966), both accompanying music by Henry Mancini.

Binder created the signature gun barrel sequence for the opening titles of the first Bond film, Dr. No (1962). Binder originally planned to employ a camera sighted down the barrel of a .38 calibre gun, but this caused some problems. Unable to stop down the lens of a standard camera enough to bring the entire gun barrel into focus, his assistant Trevor Bond created a pinhole camera to solve the problem and the barrel became crystal clear.

Binder described the genesis of the gun barrel sequence in the last interview he recorded before he died in 1991: That was something I did in a hurry, because I had to get to a meeting with the producers in twenty minutes. I just happened to have little white, price tag stickers and I thought Inulld use them as gun shots across the screen. Wenulld have James Bond walk through and fire, at which point blood comes down onscreen. That was about a twenty-minute storyboard I did, and they said, "This looks great!".

At least one critic has also observed that the sequence recalls the gun fired at the audience at the end of The Great Train Robbery (1903). Binder is also known for featuring women performing a variety of activities such as dancing, jumping on a trampoline, or shooting weapons in his work. Both sequences are trademarks and staples of the James Bond films. Maurice Binder was succeeded by Daniel Kleinman as the title designer for GoldenEye (1995).

Prior to GoldenEye, the only James Bond movies for which he did not create the opening title credits were From Russia with Love (1963) and Goldfinger (1964), both of which were designed by Robert Brownjohn.

Binder shot opening and closing sequences involving a mouse (an animal that didnullt appear in either the novel or the film) for The Mouse That Roared (1959), a sequence of monks filmed as a mosaic explaining the history of the Golden Bell in The Long Ships (1963), and a sequence of Spanish dancers explaining why the then topical reference of nuclear weapons vanishing in a B-52 mishap shifted from Spain to Greece in The Day the Fish Came Out (1967).

He designed the title sequence for Sodom and Gomorrah (1963) that featured an orgy (the only one in the film). He took three days to direct the sequence that was originally supposed to take one day.

Binder also was a producer of The Passage (1979), and a visual consultant on Dracula (1979) and Oxford Blues (1984).

Binder died from lung cancer in London, aged 72.

Her family moved to Florida when she was 17, and after graduating high school she enrolled at the Coronet Modeling School and Agency and subsequently won numerous local beauty pageants and became one of the most photographed models in Miami. Photos of Yeager appeared in over 300 newspapers and magazines.

Yeager entered photography to save money by copying her modeling photographs, enrolling in a night class at a vocational school in 1953. Her career as a professional photographer began when a picture of Maria Stinger, taken for her first school assignment, was sold to Eye magazine for the cover of the March 1954 issue. She became a technically skilled photographer noted for, among other things, her early use of the fill flash technique to lighten dark shadows when shooting in bright sun. Yeager was one of the first photographers to photograph her models outdoors with natural light. Bunny discovered legendary pin-up queen Bettie Page in 1954. Her photo of Page posing in nothing but a fur-trimmed Santa hat was published as the centerfold in the January 1955 special holiday issue of "Playboy." This photo, along with other pictures of Bettie taken by Bunny, played a key role in establishing Pagenulls iconic status. Her photographs were featured in a huge array of menulls magazines throughout the years. Bunny also published over 20 books on photography.', dob = '1929-03-13', photo_url = 'https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/nT4jqrrpEWHcJ3RiaPqm6P1rgjZ.jpg'

    SET biography = N'Henry Byron Warner (often credited as H.B. Warner; 25 October 1875 – 21 December 1958) was an English actor. He was the definitive cinematic Jesus Christ in Cecil B. DeMillenulls The King of Kings  (1927). He was born into a prominent theatrical family on October 26,  1875 in London. His father was Charles Warner, and his grandfather was  James Warner, both prominent English actors. He replaced J.B. Warner as Jesus in The King of Kings  (1927) when J.B. died of tuberculosis at age 29. (J.B. was not Henrynulls  brother. J.B. had taken the professional last name "Warner" because  Henrynulls family took him in.)

Henry Warnernulls family wanted him to  become a doctor, and he graduated from London University but eventually  gave up his medical studies. The theater was in his blood, and he  studied acting in Paris and Italy before joining his fathernulls stock  company, making his debut in the English production of "Drink." It was  from his father that he honed his craft.

Warner made it to  America in the early 1900s, after touring the British Empire. Billed as  Harry Warner, he made his Broadway debut in the American colonial drama  "Audrey" at Hoytnulls Theatre on November 24, 1902, starring James OnullNeill, the father of playwright Eugene OnullNeill.  He was billed as H.B. Warner in his next appearance on Broadway, in the  1906 comedy "Nurse Marjorie." He appeared in 13 more Broadway  productions in his career, from the twin-bill of "Susan in Search of a  Husband" & "A Tenement Tragedy" (also 1906) to "Silence" in 1925.

He moved into motion pictures, making his debut in the Mutual short Harp of Tara (1914). Also in 1914, he appeared in a film written by Cecil B. DeMille for Famous Players Lasky, The Ghost Breaker  (1914), in which he had played on Broadway the year before. Warner  became a leading man and a star in silent pictures, reaching the zenith  of his career playing Jesus in DeMillenulls The King of Kings  (1927). His excellent performance was actually enhanced by the silent  screen, allowing the audience to imagine how Jesus would sound. Warner  could be extremely moving in silent pictures, notably in the melodrama Sorrell and Son (1927) as a war veteran father who sacrifices all for his son.

When talkies arrived, he became a busy supporting player. A favorite of Frank Capra , appeared in Mr. Deeds Goes to Town (1936). Cast again by Capra, he was nominated for Best Supporting Actor in Lost Horizon (1937). He also appeared in You Canullt Take It with You (1938), and Mr. Smith Goes to Washington (1939). Other major talkies included The Devil and Daniel Webster (1941) and Topper Returns (1941). Other than Jesus, the role he is best remembered role for today is in Itnulls a Wonderful Life  (1946), in which he played Mr. Gower, the druggist who is saved from  committing a lethal medication error by the young George Bailey (the James Stewart character as a child). H.B. Warner appeared in Sunset Blvd. (1950) as himself. His last credited role was as Amminadab in DeMillenulls The Ten Commandments (1956), a remake of the earlier silent The Ten Commandments (1923). He last role was an uncredited bit part in Darbynulls Rangers (1958).', dob = '1875-10-25', photo_url = 'https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/be4wXVyhbvdbViK0gOZSrdbfie8.jpg'

Hinds was born in Brooklyn, New York, the son of Joseph E. Hinds and Mary A. Beetham Hinds.

Hindsnull first film was If I Had a Million (1932); his second film was The Road Is Open Again (1933) where he portrayed President Woodrow Wilson. His earlier career was reflected in the role of Judge Thatcher, tortured by the mad Dr. Richard Vollin (Bela Lugosi) in The Raven (1935).

Hinds acted in a total of 214 films. His last film was The Bribe, released in 1949, after his death.

Mary Treen (born Mary Louise Summers, March 27, 1907 – July 20, 1989) was an American film and television actress, a familiar face who brought levity to the screen. A minor actress for much of her career, she managed to secure a plain, unassuming niche for herself in the Hollywood of the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s.

Early years

She was born in St. Louis, Missouri, the daughter of attorney Don. C. Summers and actress Helene Sullivan Summers. In 1908, when Mary Louise was 11 months old, her mother sued her father for divorce on the grounds that he failed to provide for her. Her father died while she was an infant. She was reared in California by her mother and her stepfather, a physician. Treen attended the Westlake School for Girls and a convent where she tried out successfully in school plays.

Career

During her career, Treen was seen in over 40 films. Among her film roles were Tilly, the secretary of the Building and Loan, in Itnulls a Wonderful Life (1946) and the role of Pat in the drama Kitty Foyle (1940) starring Ginger Rogers.

Her longest-running role was as Hilda, the maid and baby nurse, in 64 episodes from 1962 to 1965 of the NBC and CBS sitcom The Joey Bishop Show. Earlier, in the 1954–1955 season, she was cast in thirty-eight episodes as Emily Dodger on the CBS sitcom Willy.

Death

Treen died of cancer in Newport Beach, California, July 20, 1989. She was 82. Her only survivors were distant cousins. One of her cousins was actor Mort Mills.', dob = '1907-03-27', photo_url = 'https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/cJWAKUmj5qP4zLfUfiYtbDQ109w.jpg'

Sheldon Leonard Bershad (February 22, 1907 – January 11, 1997) was an American film and television actor, producer, director, and writer.  Sheldon Leonard Bershad was born in Manhattan, New York City, the son of middle class Jewish parents Anna Levit and Frank Bershad. He graduated from Syracuse University in 1929.

As an actor, Leonard specialized in playing supporting characters, especially gangsters or "heavies", in films such as Itnulls a Wonderful Life (1946; as bartender Nick), To Have and Have Not (1944), Guys and Dolls (1955), and Open Secret (1948). His trademark was his especially thick New York accent, usually delivered from the side of his mouth. In Decoy (1946), Leonard uses his "heavy" persona to create the hard-boiled police detective Joe Portugal.

On radio from 1945 to 1955, Leonard played an eccentric racetrack tout on The Jack Benny Program and later in the TV series of the same name. His role was to salute Benny out of the blue in railroad stations, on street corners, or in department stores ("Hey Bud. Cnullmere a minute."), ask Benny what he was about to do, and then proceed to try to argue him out of his course of action by resorting to inane and irrelevant racing logic. As "The Tout," he never gave out information on horse racing, unless Jack demanded it. One excuse the tout gave was, "Who knows about horses?"

Leonard was part of the cast of voice actors on the Damon Runyon Theatre radio show (1948-1949). He was part of the ensemble cast of the Martin and Lewis radio show. He also appeared frequently on The Adventures of the Saint, often playing gangsters and heavies, but also sometimes in more positive roles.

Following service as a corporal in the U.S. Army infantry in the first World War, Bridge joined a theatrical troupe. He dabbled in writing and in 1930 sold a script to a short film, Her Hired Husband (1930). He followed this with a B-Western script, Godnulls Country and the Man (1931), in which he made his film debut as an actor.

For the next quarter century, he managed the atypical achievement of maintaining a career in both B-Westerns and in bigger dramatic and comedy features. Ten films for director Preston Sturges represent probably his most  familiar contribution to Hollywood history.

He was born Richard Damon Elliott in Boston, Massachusetts.

Elliott played many different roles, typically as a somewhat blustery sort, such as a politician. A short, fat man, Elliott played Santa Claus on the Jimmy Durante, Red Skelton, and Jack Benny programs. Elliott had a couple of memorable lines in Itnulls a Wonderful Life (1946), in which he scolded James Stewart, who was trying to say goodnight to Donna Reed, advising him to stop hemming and hawing and "just go ahead and kiss her".

He also had a few memorable appearances in episodes of the Adventures of Superman television series. He appeared three times as Stanley on the CBS sitcom December Bride, as well as on two of ABC/Warner Brothersnull western series, Sugarfoot and Maverick. He was cast as the prospector Peter Cooper and then as Sheriff Tiny Morris in two segments of CBSnulls Tales of the Texas Rangers. He appeared twice as Doc Thornton on ABCnulls The Real McCoys. Elliott is perhaps best known as Mayberrynulls Mayor Pike in early episodes of CBSnulls The Andy Griffith Show, one of his last screen works. In two of the eleven episodes featuring Elliot as mayor, actress Josie Lloyd portrayed his daughter.

John Farrell MacDonald (June 6, 1875 – August 2, 1952) was an American character actor and director. He played supporting roles and occasional leads. He appeared in over 325 films over a 41-year career from 1911 to 1951, and directed forty-four silent films from 1912 to 1917.

MacDonald was the principal director of L. Frank Baumnulls Oz Film Manufacturing Company, and he can frequently be seen in the films of Frank Capra, Preston Sturges and, especially, John Ford.

Early in his career, MacDonald was a singer in minstrel shows, and he toured the United States extensively for two years with stage productions. He made his first silent film in 1911, a dramatic short entitled The Scarlett Letter made by Carl Laemmlenulls Independent Moving Pictures Company (IMP), the forerunner of Universal Pictures,. He continued to act in numerous films each year from that time on, and by 1912 he was directing them as well. The first film he directed was The Worth of a Man, another dramatic short, again for IMP, and he was to direct 43 more films until his last in 1917, Over the Fence, which he co-directed with Harold Lloyd. MacDonald had crossed paths with Lloyd several years earlier, when Lloyd was an extra and MacDonald had given him much-needed work – and he did the same with Hal Roach, both of whom appearing in small roles in The Patchwork Girl of Oz, which MacDonald directed in 1914. When Roach set up his own studio, with Lloyd as his principal attraction, he hired MacDonald to direct.

By 1918, MacDonald, who was to become one of the most beloved character men in Hollywood, had given up directing and was acting full-time, predominantly in Westerns and Irish comedies. He first worked under director John Ford in 1919nulls A Fight for Love. In all, Ford would use MacDonald on twenty-five films between 1919 and 1950.

With a voice that matched his personality, MacDonald made the transition to sound films easily, with no noticeable drop in his acting output – if anything, it went up. In 1931, for instance, MacDonald appeared in 14 films – among them the first version of The Maltese Falcon, in which he played "Detective Tom Polhaus" – and in 22 of them in 1932. Although he played laborers, policemen, military men and priests, among many other characters, his roles were usually a cut above a "bit part". His characters usually had names, and he was most often credited for his performances. A highlight of this period was his performance as the hobo "Mr. Tramp" in Our Little Girl with Shirley Temple (1935).

In the 1940s, MacDonald was part of Preston Sturgesnull unofficial "stock company" of character actors, appearing in seven films written and directed by Sturges. MacDonald appeared in Sullivanulls Travels, The Palm Beach Story, The Miracle of Morganulls Creek, The Great Moment, The Sin of Harold Diddlebock, Unfaithfully Yours and The Beautiful Blonde from Bashful Bend, Sturgesnull last American film. Earlier, MacDonald had also appeared in The Power and the Glory, which Sturges wrote. His work on Sturgesnull films was generally uncredited. He was notable in 1946 in John Fordnulls My Darling Clementine in which he played "Mac," the bartender in the town saloon. MacDonald also had uncredited roles in Itnulls a Wonderful Life and Here Comes The Groom.', dob = '1875-06-05', photo_url = 'https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/hSINvJ003UJAohrEgqBPkXzu1cM.jpg'

Moroni Olsen (June 27, 1889 – November 22, 1954) was an American actor.

Olsen was born in Ogden, Utah, to Mormon parents Edward Arenholt Olsen and Martha Hoverholst, who named him after the Moroni found in the Book of Mormon. Some sources have claimed that Olsenulls birth name was John Willard Clawson, but there appears to be no support for this claim.

Olsen studied at Weber Stake Academy, the predecessor of Weber State University. He then went to study at the University of Utah, where one of his teachers was Maud May Babcock. During World War I, he sold war bonds for the United States Navy. He also studied and performed in the Eastern United States around this time.

In 1923, Olsen organized the "Moroni Olsen Players" out of Ogden. They performed at both Ogdenulls Orpheum Theatre and at various other locations spread from Salt Lake City to Seattle.

After having worked on Broadway, he made his film debut in a 1935 adaptation of The Three Musketeers. He later played a different role in a 1939 comedy version of the story, starring Don Ameche as DnullArtagnan and the Ritz Brothers as three dimwitted lackeys who are forced to substitute for the musketeers, who have drunk themselves into a stupor.

His most famous role was the voice of the Slave in The Magic Mirror in Walt Disneynulls Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937). Olsen also provided the voice of the senior angel in Itnulls a Wonderful Life.

Olsen was an active member of the LDS Church, being a teacher of youth in the Hoolwood Ward. He also was director of the Pilgramage Play of Hollywood for several years.', dob = '1889-06-26', photo_url = 'https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/xJ56TNofwpQH3b0UAs8spNq35OR.jpg'

Max Wagner (November 28, 1901 – November 16, 1975) was a Mexican-born American film actor who specialized in playing small parts such as thugs, gangsters, sailors, henchmen, bodyguards, cab drivers and moving men, appearing more than 400 films in his career, most without receiving screen credit. Newspaper gossip columnists noted his rise from playing "Gangster #4", with no lines, and not carrying a gun, to "Gangster #2", with both lines and a gun.

Wagner was one of five children, all boys, of William Wallace Wagner, a railroad conductor, and Edith Wagner, a writer who provided dispatches for the Christian Science Monitor during the Mexican Revolution. When he was 10 years old, his father was killed by rebels and the family moved to Salinas, California, where he met John Steinbeck, who became a lifelong friend. Steinback based the character of the boy in his novel The Red Pony on Wagner.

Under the name "Max Baron", Wagner acted in many Spanish-language versions of English-language films, which studios made as a matter of course in the early days of sound films, He also served as a Spanish language coach for other actors, and appeared in many of the "Mexican Spitfire" films starring Lupe Vélez, where he also served to monitor Veleznulls Spanish ad-libs for profanity.

Other series that Wagner appeared in include the Charlie Chan films, and Tom Mix serials, as well as others made by Mascot Pictures Corporation. In the 1940s, Wagner was part of Preston Sturgesnull unofficial "stock company" of character actors, appearing in six films written and directed by Sturges, beginning with The Palm Beach Story

In 1940 during the filming of "The Mad Doctor", Wagner was credited for driving 50,000 miles as an on-screen taxi driver on the studio back lots of Hollywood. Since his appearance as a cab driver in Charlie Chan in Shanghai (1935), producers often cast him as a wise-cracking or henchman taxi driver. "I was cast as a taxi driver about five years ago", Wagner told a reporter. "And I was typed."

In 1952, Wagner began to appear on television, in episodes of such shows as The Cisco Kid, Zane Grey Theater and Perry Mason, playing much the same kind of parts he played in the movies.

He was a regular cast member on the western television series Gunsmoke, making nearly 80 appearances between 1959 and 1973. He also appeared in many episodes of The Rifleman, Bonanza, Cimarron Strip, The Wild Wild West and Maverick, including a guest-starring role in the 1959 Rifleman episode "Blood Brother." He also had roles in the original Star Trek and The Twilight Zone series. He appeared in more than 200 television episodes between 1952 and 1974.

Notable film roles for Wagner include a supporting role in the cult science fiction classic Invaders from Mars (1953), an actor playing a gangster in the film-within-a-film segment of Bullets or Ballots (1936), and the bull farm attendant in the Laurel and Hardy comedy The Bullfighters (1945).

Late in his career, he appeared in To Kill a Mockingbird (1962) and The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance (1962). He also occasionally composed music, such as the Mexican folk ballad "Pedro, Rudarte y Simon" in the Western film The Last Trail (1933).

Born in New York City in 1894, the white-haired, burly actor was often typecast as an earnest police officer, newspaper editor or principal. He appeared in over 250 films between 1928 and 1948, mostly playing small supporting roles with a few sentences.

Albert Maurice Hackett (February 16, 1900 – March 16, 1995) was an American dramatist and screenwriter most noted for his collaborations with his partner and wife Frances Goodrich.

Hackett was born in New York City, the son of actress Florence Hackett (née Hart) and Maurice Hackett.  Not long after marrying screenwriter Frances Goodrich, the couple went to Hollywood in the late 1920s to write the screenplay for their stage success Up Pops the Devil for Paramount Pictures. In 1933 they signed a contract with MGM and remained with them until 1939. Among their earliest assignments was writing the screenplay for The Thin Man (1934). They were encouraged by the director W. S. Van Dyke to use the writing of Dashiell Hammett as a basis only, and to concentrate on providing witty exchanges for the principal characters, Nick and Nora Charles (played by William Powell and Myrna Loy). The resulting film was one of the major hits of the year, and the script, considered to show a modern relationship in a realistic manner for the first time, was considered to be groundbreaking. However this is only because it was written and released before the enactment of the Hollywood Production Code, which strictly censored movies from mid-1934 until the early 1960s (see Pre-Code). The other Nick and Nora films show a steep decline regarding the "groundbreaking maturity" of the Charlesesnull marriage.

The Hacketts received Academy Award for Screenplay nominations for The Thin Man, After the Thin Man (1936), Father of the Bride (1950) and Seven Brides for Seven Brothers (1955).[1] They won Writers Guild of America awards for Easter Parade (1949), Fathernulls Little Dividend (1951), Seven Brides for Seven Brothers (1954), and The Diary of Anne Frank (1959), as well as nominations for In the Good Old Summertime (1949), Father of the Bride (1950) and The Long, Long Trailer (1954).

    SET biography = N'Stephen Keith Kloves (born March 18, 1960) is an American screenwriter, director, and producer. He wrote and directed the film The Fabulous Baker Boys and is mainly known for his screenplay adaptations of novels, especially for all but one of the Harry Potter films (the exception being The Order of the Phoenix) and for Wonder Boys, for which he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay.

Kloves, born in Austin, Texas, grew up in Sunnyvale, California, where he graduated from Fremont High School. He attended the University of California, Los Angeles, but dropped out when he was not admitted into the film school in his third year.

As an unpaid intern for a Hollywood agent, he gained attention for a screenplay he wrote called Swings. This led to a meeting where he successfully pitched Racing with the Moon (1984).

His first experience with professional screenwriting left him wanting more interaction with the actors so that the characters would stay true to his vision. Kloves wrote The Fabulous Baker Boys and also intended it to be his directorial debut. After years of trying to sell the project in Hollywood, the film finally got off the ground and was released in 1989. The Fabulous Baker Boys did reasonably well and was critically acclaimed, but his next shot as writer/director for Flesh and Bone in 1993 fared poorly at the box office. Kloves then stopped writing for three years.

Realising that he had to return to writing to support his family, he began adapting Michael Chabonulls novel Wonder Boys into a screenplay. Kloves was offered the chance to direct, but he declined, preferring to direct only his own original work. This was his first try at adapting another work to film. His screenplay was nominated for a Golden Globe and an Academy Award after the filmnulls release in 2000.

Warner Bros. sent Kloves a list of novels that the company was considering adapting as films. The listing included the first Harry Potter novel, which intrigued him despite his usual indifference to these catalogs. He went on to write the screenplays for the first four films in the series. However, he turned down writing the fifth film, stating that "The fourth film, Goblet of Fire, was really hard to do. I wrote on it for two years. But it’s not that simple, and I donullt know that Inullll ever fully understand why I didnullt do it." After Michael Goldenberg wrote the screenplay for the fifth film, Kloves then returned to write the sixth, seventh, and eighth installments.

In 2011, Kloves was attached to work on a film adaptation of Mark Haddonulls novel The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time.

Since 2016, Kloves produced the Fantastic Beasts films, a spinoff prequel series to the main Harry Potter series. Kloves co-wrote the third installment with J.K. Rowling.

Kloves produced the Andy Serkis-directed movie, Mowgli: Legend of the Jungle. His daughter, Callie, wrote the screenplay.

Kloves is now set to write the screenplay for the film adaptation of T. J. Newmanulls novel Drowning: The Rescue of Flight 1421 for Warner Bros.

    SET biography = N'Linda Ann Gray (born September 12, 1940) is an American film, stage and television actress, director, producer and former model, best known for her role as Sue Ellen Ewing, the long-suffering wife of Larry Hagmanulls character J.R. Ewing on the CBS television drama series Dallas (1978–1989, 1991, 2012–2014), for which she was nominated for the 1981 Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series. The role also earned her two Golden Globe Awards.

Gray began her career in the 1960s in television commercials. In the 1970s, she appeared in numerous TV series before landing the role of Sue Ellen Ewing in 1978. After leaving Dallas in 1989, she appeared opposite Sylvester Stallone in the 1991 film Oscar. From 1994 to 1995, she played a leading role in the Fox drama series Models Inc., and also starred in TV movies, including Moment of Truth: Why My Daughter? (1993) and Accidental Meeting (1994). She went on to reprise the role of Sue Ellen in Dallas: J.R. Returns (1996), Dallas: War of the Ewings (1998), and in the TNT series Dallas (2012–2014), which continued the original series.

On stage, Gray starred as Mrs. Robinson in The Graduate in the West End of London in 2001, then on Broadway the following year. In 2007, she starred as Aurora Greenaway in the world premiere production of Terms of Endearment at the Theatre Royal, York and stayed with the production when it toured the United Kingdom. After the second Dallas was cancelled in 2014, Gray again took to the stage, this time in the role of the Fairy Godmother in a London production of Cinderella.

Linda Gray was born in 1940 in Santa Monica, California. She grew up in Culver City, California, where her father, Leslie, who was a watchmaker, had a shop.

Before acting, Gray worked as a model in the 1960s and began her acting career in television commercials, nearly 400 of them—and also made brief appearances in feature films, such as Under the Yum Yum Tree and Palm Springs Weekend in 1963.

Gray began her professional acting career in the 1970s with guest roles on many television series such as Marcus Welby, M.D., McCloud, and Switch, prior to signing with Universal Studios in 1974. She also appeared in the films The Big Rip-Off (1975) and Dogs (1976). In 1977, she was cast as fashion model Linda Murkland, the first transgender series regular on American television, in the television series All That Glitters. The show, a spoof of the soap-opera format, was cancelled after just 13 weeks. Gray was then cast as suspicious wife Carla Cord in the 1977 television movie Murder in Peyton Place. ...

    SET biography = N'John “Biggles” Higgins is an Irish-born gaffer known for his extensive work in cinema lighting, especially in collaboration with leading cinematographers like Roger Deakins and Emmanuel Lubezki. Born in Athlone, Republic of Ireland, in 1953, after leaving school, he trained as an electrician. Then he moved to England, where he undertook further evening courses to become an electrical engineer. He spent about three years working for Shell UK.

His first film work was as an electrician in the lighting department, including on The Great Muppet Caper (1981) and The Dark Crystal (1982). His first job as a full gaffer on a 35 mm film was Nineteen Eighty-Four (1984), which Roger Deakins shot.

Over his career, he has worked on over sixty feature films. Some of his notable credits include Skyfall (2012), Gravity(2013), Thor: The Dark World (2013), Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (2007), Sleepy Hollow (1999), The Bourne Ultimatum (2007), Children of Men (2006), and Mamma Mia! (2008).

Higgins has spoken often about his approach to lighting, emphasising both technical understanding (especially of electrical systems) and collaboration with directors of photography. He values testing and careful preparation (such as lighting tests). He believes that understanding different approaches from various cinematographers enriches his work.

He is known by the nickname “Biggles,” partly for his long-standing moustache and characteristic style. He currently resides in London.', dob = null, photo_url = 'https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/v3yFh68yDMzBvXJtUwMAWUXhfgK.jpg'

Barbier was born at Saint-Ouen, Seine (currently Seine-Saint-Denis), France. During his career (1964 to 1997), he specialized in drama rather than comedy. In film, he held several leading roles but is especially distinguished in auxiliary roles depicting more limited characters. He is especially remembered for his first-class performance in Army of Shadows by Jean-Pierre Melville in 1969. Appearing in a number of soaps and TV shows of the late 1960s to early 1980s, Barbier gained a certain notoriety thanks to the character of Joseph Durtol, bounded and proud hero of The Man of Picardy, the legendary French television series. He died in Manosque (Alpes de Haute-Provence), aged 85.

    SET biography = N'Serge Reggiani (2 May 1922 – 23 July 2004) was an Italian-born French singer and actor. He was born in Reggio Emilia, Italy and moved to France with his parents at the age of eight. For many years, he struggled with alcoholism, caused in part by the 1980 suicide of his son Stephan.

After acting school (Conservatoire des arts cinématographiques) he was discovered by Jean Cocteau and appeared in a wartime production of Les Parents terribles ("The Terrible Parents"). During World War II, he left Paris to join the French resistance.

His first feature film came in 1946 with his role in Les portes de la nuit ("The Doors of the Night"). He later went on to perform in 80 films including Casque dnullor, Les Misérables (1958),Tutti a casa, Le Doulos, Il Gattopardo, La terrazza, The Pianist (1998).

In spite of never quite reaching the peak with his acting career, he did triumph in the theatre in 1959 with his performance in Jean-Paul Sartre’s play Les Séquestrés dnullAltona. In the meantime, though, in 1965 he began a second career, that of a singer (at the age of 43), with the help of Simone Signoret and her husband Yves Montand and later with great assistance of the French diva Barbara. Reggiani became one of the most acclaimed performers of French "Chanson" ("song") and although he was in his 40s, his bad-boy rugged image made him popular with both young and older listeners.

His best known songs include Les loups sont entrés dans Paris ("The Wolves Have Entered Paris") and Sarah (La femme qui est dans mon lit) ("The Woman Who Is In My Bed"), the latter written by Georges Moustaki. However, one of his regular songwriters throughout his career was Boris Vian (Le Déserteur, Arthur où tnullas mis le corps, La Java des bombes atomiques). His new young fans identified with his left-wing ideals and antimilitarism, most notably during the 1968 student revolts in France. With age he became more and more acclaimed as one of the best interpreters of the French chanson also bringing the poetry of Rimbaud, Apollinaire and Prévert closer to his audience. In 1995, he made a comeback to the singing stage, giving a few concerts despite his deteriorated health and personal distress, the last one being held as late as in the year of his death, in spring of 2004.

In later life he became a painter and gave a number of exhibitions of his artwork.

Serge Reggiani died in Paris of a heart attack at the age of 82, one day after the death of another well known French singer Sacha Distel. He is interred in Montparnasse Cemetery.', dob = '1922-05-02', photo_url = 'https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/7URSpmWp6SDIfLhKoPExc2oueet.jpg'

    SET biography = N'Jean-Pierre Grumbach (20 October 1917 – 2 August 1973), known professionally as Jean-Pierre Melville (French: [mɛlvil]), was a French filmmaker. Considered a spiritual father of the French New Wave, he was one of the first fully-independent French filmmakers to achieve commercial and critical success. His works include the crime dramas Bob le flambeur (1956), Le Doulos (1962), Le Samouraï (1967), and Le Cercle Rouge (1970), and the war films Le Silence de la mer (1949) and Army of Shadows (1969).

Melvillenulls subject matter and approach to filmmaking was heavily influenced by his service in the French Resistance during World War II, during which he adopted the pseudonym nullMelvillenull as a tribute to his favorite American author Herman Melville. He kept it as his stage name once the war was over.

His sparse, existentialist but stylish approach to film noir and later neo-noir films, many of them in the crime dramas, have been highly influential to future generations of filmmakers. Roger Ebert appraised him as "one of the greatest directors."

    SET biography = N'Joseph Kessel (10 February 1898 – 23 July 1979), also known as "Jef" was a French journalist and novelist. He was a member of the Académie française and Grand Officer of the Legion of Honour.

Kessel was born to a Jewish family in Villa Clara, Entre Ríos, Argentina, because of the constant journeys of his father, a Litvak physician. From 1905 to 1908, Joseph Kessel lived the first years of his childhood in Orenburg, Russia, before the family moved to France in 1908. He studied in lycée Masséna, Nice and lycée Louis-le-Grand, Paris and took part in the First World War as an aviator. He was also an aviator during the Second World War, in the Free French Groupe de Bombardement n° 1/20 "Lorraine" (342 Squadron RAF) with RAF Bomber Command, with Romain Gary, who was also a talented French novelist.

Kessel wrote several novels and books that were later represented in the cinema, notably Belle de Jour (by Luis Buñuel in 1967). In 1943 he and his nephew Maurice Druon translated Anna Marlynulls song Chant des Partisans into French from its original Russian. The song became one of the anthems of Free French Forces during the Second World War.

Kessel was elected to the Académie française in 1962 and died on 23 July 1979 in Avernes, Val-dnullOise of a ruptured aneurysm. He is buried in the Cimetière du Montparnasse in Paris. On his deathbed he was quoted as saying that his greatest accomplishment was the birth of his son, Joseph Kessel, who was born just a few months prior on 24 February of the same year. The Joseph-Kessel Prize (Prix Joseph Kessel) is a prestigious prize in French language literature, given to "a book of a high literary value written in French". The jury counts or has counted among its members Tahar Ben Jelloun, Jean-Marie Drot, Michèle Kahn, Pierre Haski, Gilles Lapouge, Michel Le Bris [fr], Érik Orsenna, Patrick Rambaud, Jean-Christophe Rufin, André Velter and Olivier Weber.

    SET biography = N'Françoise Bonnot (17 August 1939 – 9 June 2018) was a French film editor with more than 40 feature film credits.

Bonnot was the daughter of Monique Bonnot, a film editor noted for several films directed by Jean-Pierre Melville. In her first film credit, Françoise Bonnot was the assistant to her mother on Melvillenulls 1959 film, Two Men in Manhattan (1959). She and her mother co-edited the 1962 film, A Monkey in Winter, that was directed by Henri Verneuil. At about this time Bonnot married Verneuil; she edited three more of his films in the 1960s. Bonnot edited Melvillenulls 1969 film, Army of Shadows, when her mother became unavailable. This film is about the French resistance fighters during the Second World War, and was a departure from Melvillenulls more characteristic crime and detective films. Bonnot later remarked that Melville “... had known me since I was eight years old. It was like working with my big brother. He was a character––fascinating, charming, fun and tyrannical.”

By 1968, Bonnot had commenced her notable collaboration with director Costa-Gavras that extended over eight films and nearly 30 years. Their first film together was Z (1969); James Berardinelli has written recently that, "Z was the third feature film from Greek-born Costa-Gavras, but it is the movie that captured him to the worldnulls attention, winning a Best Foreign Language Film Oscar. It introduced the directornulls signature approach of combining overt political messages with edge-of-the-seat tension." After Z, their most widely recognized film together is probably Missing (1982). Their last film together was Mad City (1997).

Throughout her life, Bonnot edited the films directed by Julie Taymor, who had been known primarily as a stage director. Their films include Frida (2002) and The Tempest (2010).

Bonnot won the Academy Award for Film Editing for Z (1969), and the BAFTA Award for Best Editing for Missing (1982). She was nominated three times for the César Award for Best Editing (for The Simple Past (1977), Hannah K. (1983) and Place Vendôme (1998)). She had been elected to membership in the American Cinema Editors.

Bonnot and Henri Verneuil had two children. Their son, Patrick Malakian, is a film director; Bonnot edited his 1994 French-language film Pourquoi maman est dans mon lit?. Bonnot died on 9 June 2018 in Paris, France aged 78.

She earned the title of Miss France Monde (the French representative of Miss World) and was also the first runner-up in the 1958 Miss World contest.

Auger was born in Paris, France. She made her film debut when still in school.

When she was 18, she married the 43-year-old writer-director Pierre Gaspard-Huit (the couple later divorced). He cast her in several films, including Le Masque de fer (1962) and Kali Yug: Goddess of Vengeance (1963).

When she was on holiday in Nassau, writer-producer Kevin McClory saw Auger and recommended that she audition for his film Thunderball (1965). The role of Domino was originally to be an Italian woman, Dominetta Petacchi. Auger impressed the producers so much that they rewrote the part to that of a French woman, to better suit her. Although she took lessons to perfect her English, her voice was eventually dubbed by Nikki van der Zyl. Thunderball launched Auger into a successful European movie career, but did little for her otherwise in the United States.

    SET biography = N'Evan Call was born in Lincoln, California. Although his brother and sister both played violin when they were children, he did not develop real interest music until he was thirteen. Growing up in a country town, he began taking bluegrass guitar lessons from a local teacher, John Massey. This was a big turning point in his life as it was the gateway to a new world.

As he started his studies in guitar, he developed a condition known as "Occipital Neuralgia" which caused incessant, extreme headaches. He could not attend school due to the pain, so he continued his studies at home and sent his work to school. As a wrestler, runner, and soccer player, this also was a big imposition not only on his academic endeavors, but also on his athletic lifestyle. During this time, as he could not do much else, he focused intensely on music. For the next three months, he spent the majority of his time playing guitar until he was able to return to school after the pain had subsided enough. However, it was not until four years later that he completely recovered.

When he was sixteen, he picked up electric guitar and learned a great deal from a good friend of his, Matt Di Giordano. At this point, he branched out from just fingerstyle guitar to metal, a genre that has had a great influence on his development as a musician. Inspired by his friend, he began to write his own music. Starting with fingerstyle tunes and metal, he eventually delved into other kinds of music, specifically orchestral music (often used in his metal tunes) and video game music.

At the same time he began playing electric guitar, he developed an interest in singing. After singing for a couple years on his own, he began taking classical lessons from a local vocal teacher, Chris Bello, and participated in a local theater production. He began to develop his technique as a classical/musical theater singer and has continued to develop over these past few years. As a voice principal at Berklee, he is branching out into other styles such as: rock, jazz, latin, etc...

His deep interest in other cultures has also had a huge influence on his music. Aside from his native language of English, he also speaks proficient Japanese and Spanish. Although not an expert, he plays other instruments such as: Sanshin, Ryuuteki, Hichiriki, Quena, Flauta Dulce, Ocarina, Balalaika, and Charango. As a film scoring major at Berklee, he continues to apply everything he has learned throughout his life to further his ability and competency in the music world.

He currently resides in Tokyo and belonged to the music production group Elements Garden until 2016.', dob = '1988-06-29', photo_url = null

    SET biography = N'Victor-Marie Hugo, vicomte Hugo (26 February 1802 – 22 May 1885) was a French Romantic author, poet, essayist, playwright, journalist, human rights activist and politician.

His most famous works are the novels The Hunchback of Notre-Dame (1831) and Les Misérables (1862). In France, Hugo is renowned for his poetry collections, such as Les Contemplations and La Légende des siècles (The Legend of the Ages). Hugo was at the forefront of the Romantic literary movement with his play Cromwell and drama Hernani. His works have inspired music, both during his lifetime and after his death, including the opera Rigoletto and the musicals Les Misérables and Notre-Dame de Paris. He produced more than 4,000 drawings in his lifetime, and campaigned for social causes such as the abolition of capital punishment and slavery.

Although he was a committed royalist when young, Hugonulls views changed as the decades passed, and he became a passionate supporter of republicanism, serving in politics as both deputy and senator. His work touched upon most of the political and social issues and the artistic trends of his time. His opposition to absolutism, and his literary stature, established him as a national hero. Hugo died on 22 May 1885, aged 83. He was given a state funeral in the Panthéon of Paris, which was attended by over two million people, the largest in French history. ...

    SET biography = N'Haggis began to work as a writer for television programs, including The Love Boat, One Day at a Time, Diffnullrent Strokes, and The Facts of Life. With The Facts of Life, Haggis also gained his first credit as producer. During the 1980s and 1990s, Haggis wrote for television series including thirtysomething, The Tracey Ullman Show, FM, Due South, L.A. Law, and EZ Streets. He helped to create the television series Walker, Texas Ranger; Family Law; and Due South. Haggis served as executive producer of the series Michael Hayes and Family Law.

He gained recognition in the film industry for his work on the 2004 film Million Dollar Baby, which Allmovie described as a "serious milestone" for the writer/producer, and as "his first high-profile foray into feature film". Haggis had read two stories written by Jerry Boyd, a boxing trainer who wrote under the name of F.X. Toole.

Haggis later acquired the rights to the stories, and developed them into the screenplay for Million Dollar Baby. Clint Eastwood portrayed the lead character in the film. Eastwood also directed the film, and used the screenplay written by Haggis. Million Dollar Baby received four Academy Awards including the Academy Award for Best Picture.

After Million Dollar Baby, Haggis worked on the 2004 film Crash. Haggis came up with the story for the film on his own, and then wrote and directed the film, which allowed him greater control over his work. Crash was his first experience as director of a major feature film. Highly positive upon release, critical reception of Crash has since polarized, although Roger Ebert called it the best film of 2005.

Crash received Academy Award nominations for Best Picture and Best Director, in addition to four other Academy Award nominations. Haggis received two Academy Awards for the film: Best Picture (as its producer), and Best Writing for his work on the screenplay. With Million Dollar Baby and then Crash, Haggis became the first individual to have written Best Picture Oscar-winners in two consecutive years.

Haggis said that he wrote Crash to "bust liberals", arguing that his fellow liberals were not honest with themselves about the nature of race and racism because they believed that most racial problems had already been resolved in American society.', dob = '1953-03-10', photo_url = 'https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/bO2CPKFOtv1uigPM8crWTC071wr.jpg'

    SET biography = N'Richard Pearson (born 1961) is an American film editor who is mainly associated with action films. Pearson, with Clare Douglas and Christopher Rouse, received the BAFTA Award for Best Editing for the film United 93 (2006).

Pearson was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota, and raised in New Hope, Minnesota. As a college student in the early 1980s, Pearson was an intern at the television station WCCO-TV in Minneapolis. He moved to Hollywood in 1985 to pursue a career in the entertainment industry. His first editing credit was for the television miniseries From the Earth to the Moon (1998). The "1968" episode of From the Earth to the Moon was nominated for an American Cinema Editors "Eddie" award (Best Edited Episode from a Television Mini-Series) and for an Emmy Award (Outstanding Single Camera Picture Editing for a Miniseries or a Movie). Christopher Rouse, Pearsonulls co-editor on The Bourne Supremacy and United 93, also worked on this miniseries.

Following an editing credit for the film Muppets from Space (1999), Pearson edited two films (Bowfinger and The Score) that were directed by Frank Oz, who was Jim Hensonulls early collaborator in developing The Muppets.

United 93 was directed by Paul Greengrass, who is particularly noted for films that are "shot verité style as a detailed mass of hectic vignettes—jagged jump cuts, sudden blackouts, overlapping everything." The use of three editors (Douglas, Pearson, and Rouse) on United 93 was dictated by its short post-production period; less than six months passed between the start of filming and the release of the film. Greengrass and Douglas had worked together quite successfully on the film Bloody Sunday (2002); Greengrass, Pearson, and Rouse had recently finished The Bourne Supremacy (2004). Despite the accelerated post-production schedule for United 93, the editing was very successful. Ellen Feldman has written an analysis of the filmnulls editing; she notes that "United 93 represents a complex editing feat, with a structure based on parallel cutting combined with an edgy, hyper-cranked "Cinema Verité” style, a style that disorients us but doesnullt prevent us from grasping lots of necessary exposition and identifying with many characters." In addition to the BAFTA Award, the editors were also nominated for an Academy Award for Film Editing and for an ACE Eddie Award.

Pearson has been elected to membership in the American Cinema Editors.

Pearson was an editor of the James Bond film, Quantum of Solace (2008), along with Matt Chessé. He worked on Safe House (2012). He resides in California.

    SET biography = N'Van Damme was born Jean-Claude Camille François van Varenberg in Berchem-Sainte-Agathe, Brussels, Belgium, to Eliana and Eugène van Varenberg, an accountant. “The Muscles from Brussels” started martial arts at the age of eleven. His father introduced him to martial arts when he saw his son was physically weak. At the age of 12, van Damme began his martial arts training at Centre National De Karate (National Center of Karate) under the guidance of Master Claude Goetz in Ixelles, Belgium. Van Damme trained for 4 years and earned a spot on the Belgium Karate Team. He won the European professional karate associationulls middleweight championship as a teenager, and also beat the 2nd best karate fighter in the world. His goal was to be number one but got sidetracked when he left his hometown of Brussels.

In 1976 at the age of sixteen, Jean-Claude started his Martial Arts fight career. Jean-Claude retired from martial arts in 1982, following a knockout over Nedjad Gharbi in Brussels, Belgium. Jean-Claude posted a 18-1 (18 knockouts) kickboxing record, and a semi-contact record of 41-4.  He came to Hong Kong at the age of 19 for the first time and felt insured to do action movies in Hong Kong. In 1981, van Damme moved to Los Angeles. He took English classes while working as carpet layer, pizza delivery man, limo driver, and thanks to Chuck Norris he got a job as a bouncer at a club. Norris gave van Damme a small role in the movie Missing in Action (1984), but it wasnullt good enough to get anybodynulls attention. In 1984, he got his first significant role as a villain named Ivan in the low-budget movie, No Retreat, No Surrender (1986). Then one day, while walking on the streets, Jean-Claude spotted a producer for Cannon Pictures and showed some of his martial arts abilities which led to a role in Bloodsport (1988). The movie, filmed in Hong Kong, was so bad when it was completed, it was shelved for almost two years. It might have never been released if van Damme did not help them to re-cut the film and begged producers to release it. They finally released the film, first in Malaysia and France and then into the US shot on a meager 1.5 million dollar budget, it became a US box-office hit in the spring of 1988. It made about 30 million worldwide and audiences supported this film for its new sensational action star, Jean-Claude van Damme.

His good looks led to starring roles in higher budgeted movies like Cyborg (1989), AWOL: Absent Without Leave (1990), Double Impact (1991) and Universal Soldier (1992). In 1994, he scored with his big breakthrough $100 million worldwide hit Timecop (1994). But in the meantime, his personal life was coming apart. A divorce, followed by a new marriage, followed by another divorce. It began to show up in his career when his projects began to tank at the box office: The Quest (1996), which he directed; Maximum Risk (1996) and Double Team (1997). The three films made less than $50 million combined. In 1999, he remarried his ex-wife, Gladys Portugues, and restarted his lost career to attain new goals. With help from his family, he faced his problems and made movies like Replicant (2001), Derailed (2002), and In Hell (2003).', dob = '1960-10-18', photo_url = 'https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/v4hqSYeG17WOMp0xNjoWgi8Vbyn.jpg'

    SET biography = N'Michaël Benayoun (born 1973), known professionally as Michaël Youn, is a French actor, singer, comedian and television personality.

Youn was born Michaël Benayoun in Suresnes, France, to a family of Hungarian, Italian, Moroccan-Jewish, and Algerian-Jewish descent.

After his education as an announcer and theater actor, Youn joined the Paris radio station Skyrock in 1998. There, he made sketches and further entertainment during the morning show.

The popularity and success of Michael Youn, at the most important French private broadcast station brought Youn to the attention of French TV executives. In July 2000, he was hired for the new morning show "Morning Live" shown on Métropole 6. With Vincent Desagnat and Benjamin Morgaine, Youn did the entertainment part of the show. Like their sketches and public events (e.g. foam bath in a Paris fountain, and waking random Parisians up shooting the slogan of the show at them), their parodies were particularly successful. In particular, they parodied the music scene of Jean-Michel Jarre, casting-popstars, the Grand Prix and French rappers.

The success of "Morning Live" was mainly due to Youn and his colleagues – when they left the show, it remained on the air for just one more year.

After leaving "Morning Live" in 2002, Youn, Desagnat and Morgaine have focused on their music parodies: The three sailors "Piotr", "Olaff" and "Dvorjak" from the Eastern European "Slowakistan", the Bratisla Boys, appeared on the Western music market with their song "Stach Stach". The act became a big success and was number one on the French charts for ten weeks. On a 2004 list of the all-time best selling CDs in France, "Stach Stach" was listed number 30. The success even spread beyond the French border and reached Switzerland, where it was 2nd on the official charts. On 7 July 2002, the project was stopped by its makers. They claimed that the Bratisla Boys had vanished on the Dead Sea without a trace.

In 2003, the film "La Beuze", written by Youn and Desagnat, was released. Youn played the character of Alphonse, the "unknown son" of James Brown, who tries to start his own career – by creating a new (fictional) style called "Frunkp" (a mixture of funk and rap). The song "Le Frunkp" was published as a CD-single and Michaël Youn (under the name of Alphonse Brown) had another hit. This time, he even reached #1 in Swiss charts.

Youn had a comedy-tour, called Pluskapoil in 2003/04 (its sequel followed in 2005) and has acted in films. New music projects followed: Les Conards (The Imbeciles) with Comme des Connards, a cover version of My Sharona by The Knack, as well as a song for the movie Iznogoud (both were in the French Top 20). He had small roles in rather big films, and was part of Les 11 commandements in 2004 (A French film done in the style of MTVnulls Jackass, together with Desagnat and Morgaine).

In 2005, Youn was Iznogoud in the film version of the comic "Iznogoud" (also known as Isnogud). In 2006, he had the main role in the film comedy Incontrôlable. Those two films were not very successful, critics and viewers finding them only so-so. Both films starred Desagnat and Morgaine, but only in small roles.

In 2010, he directed his first movie "Fatal" in which he also stars. ...

    SET biography = N'Élie Semoun (born Élie Semhoun on 16 October 1963) is a French comedian, actor, director, writer and singer.

Élie Semoun was born in France, to a Sephardic Jewish family of Moroccan-Jewish and Algerian-Jewish descent. In 1980 at the age of 17, Semoun wrote two collections of poems and two plays. Beginning in 1988, he had regular appearances on the television series Vivement lundi! on TF1, where he played a horse mounted on rollers.

His comedy career began in 1990 with his partner Dieudonné Mnullbala Mnullbala, with whom he wrote and performed daring, skits with scathing takes generally taboo subjects such as racism and poverty, often playing up contrasts between himself and his partner in terms of origin, color, and religion.

Their first show was held at Café de la Gare in 1991. The duo acquired a certain notoriety in 1992 after several appearances on their fellow comedian Arthurnulls show Emission Impossible, where they were noticed for their particularly corrosive sketches. They followed this up with one success after another at Le Splendid Theater, Parisnulls Palais des glaces, and at Casino de Paris. Élie and Dieudonné formed one of the most popular comic duos of the 1990s.

In 1997 the duo split due to artistic and financial differences. Élie resented how Dieudonné handled their relations with the media and admitted that he was unhappy that his friend had turned towards film (and that he left to appear in the United States) and antisemitism. Dieudonné managed the financial aspects of their career, and Semoun felt their money was not divided equitably.

Breaking out on his own, Semoun continued his success with Petites Annonces dnullÉlie (which had been at first intended to be a show with Dieudonné) alongside his friend the actor Franck Dubosc. Once again his performance was promoted by his friend on the show Les Enfants de la télé (France) Inspired by actual classified ads recorded by them in a van, the "Petites Annonces dnullÉlie" (Élienulls Classified Ads) are seen through the character of Cyprian, a repulsive looking man searching for a "busty blond".

Semoun went back on stage with a one-man show, Élie and Semoun. He supported Bertrand Delanoë during Parisnulls municipal elections of 2001 and Lionel Jospin during the presidential election of 2002. In 2003, he released an album of French songs called simply "Chansons". In early 2005, he performed in a show (co-authored with Franck Dubosc and Muriel Robin entitled Élie Semoun se prend pour qui?

Élie Semoun maintained in the years following his separation with Dieudonné a complex and strained relationship with his former partner. First strained, then reconciled, they have again grown apart during the public controversy aroused by the political stances of Dieudonné. "Some have speculated on the reunion of our duo, but I must tell you that this is clearly out of the question! Itnulls over." In 2012, he declared that "the Dieudonné he knew and the Dieudonné of today appear to him like two completely different people, and he is unable to reconcile them in his mind". ...

Most of which have had some environmental grounding - The Babe movies, Happy Feet, the Guardians of GanullHoole Owl movie, the Peter Rabbit movies, even The Lego movies and The Matrix movies are trying to get humans to open their eyes and work together with the world around them.

1999 Temet Noscoe. Neo knows the Matrix code was designed and created for a specific purpose - to trigger an emotional response. Compassion and empathy for the world around us and to save humanity from itself. The Matrix code 25th anniversary. Deja Vu the code is in flux. Shooting stars of Katakana with trails of P1 phosphor green cross the screen. Matching traditional Japanese calligraphy they become falling stars. Slowed they resemble tears of White rain [Eirys] creating a melancholy forest of Green [Coeden] where Mriga and her starry friends dwell. Long before stone circles there were glades in ancient forests called leynulls, the sun delivered the time of day, the stars the night and the surrounding ring of trees the changing seasons. The tears of rain are White trunks of Beithe, the first of thirteen different species of trees surrounding each ley, with their own code and calendar. Frequented by Creatures long before the Longlegs arrived, these leynulls were connected to others by ley or song lines.

All First Nation stories weave us into our environment, we should be part of its code. There is more to this world if we just slow down, wait and listen.

I now spend my days with the mimlafoundation, between the Golden Valley sanctuary and the city. The fox, hedgehog, little bird and all our friends visiting my waking life and my dreams. Delivering you the mimlacode, raw and free as is their directive, without the assistance of AI. Offering up an alternative - a little ray of hope to this wonderful world we call home. Cup and key to set you free, ring of stone to bring you home. The Oracle, Keymaker and Gatekeepernulls are active and have the rainbow scabbard - the Eirys Coeden in all of us.

Due to his androgynous beauty,] Gillet was then sent to Japan by an agency for four months to land modelling contracts but once in Tokyo, he found no work or relationship and felt lost in translation. From this failure, Gillet drew motivation declaring: "This period of hardship I went through there forced me to reflect and made me mature. I returned to France with the nullniaquenull: no more dilemmas, I want to play. I changed my life."

He first appeared on stage in the title role of Caligula, in a celebrated staging by Charles Berling. He made his television debut in 2005, in the role of Hugh Despenser the Younger in the remake miniseries Les Rois maudits, based on the French novel series of the same name by Maurice Druon. He also appeared in series such as Éternelle and Un village français.His debut in cinema came in 2006, with Nouvelle chance by Anne Fontaine and Lnullhomme de sa vie by Zabou Breitman. The following year, he appeared in acclaimed director Eric Rohmernulls final film, Les Amours dnullAstrée et de Céladon.

Gillet publicly shares on social media that his partner is musician, singer and actor Brice Michelini from Cannes who appeared in Rebecca Zlotowskinulls Planétarium (2016). When asked why he chose to write the song Andy, I Love You (French: Andy, Je Tnullaime) and have him acting in the music video, Michelini declared: "Because I love Andy. Andy, henulls the man I love. This name came to me before I even made music. Andy is a muse: not just mine, a lot of peoplenulls muse. For me it was a waste to live with a muse and not do anything with it."

Before becoming an actor, he worked as an auto mechanic, used car salesman, prestige car salesman, and as a male model, in London, England. In 1968, Lazenby was cast as "James Bond", despite his only previous acting experience being in commercials, and his only film appearance being a bit-part in a 1965 Italian-made Bond spoof. Lazenby won the role based on a screen-test fight scene, the strength of his interviews, fight skills and audition footage. A chance encounter with Bond series producer Albert R. Broccoli in a hair salon in 1966, in London, had given Lazenby his first shot at getting the role. Broccoli had made a mental note to remember Lazenby as a possible candidate at the time when he thought Lazenby looked like a Bond. The lengths Lazenby went to, to get the role included, spending his last pounds on acquiring a tailor-made suit from Sean Connerynulls tailor, which was originally made for Connery, along with purchasing a very Bondish-looking Rolex watch, and an Aston Martin DB5 car, the Bond car at the time. Lazenby quit the role of Bond right before the premiere of his only film, On her Majestynulls Secret Service (1969), citing he would get other acting roles, and that his Bond contract, which was fourteen pages thick, was too demanding on him. In his post-Bond career, Lazenby has acted in TV movies, commercials, various recurring roles in TV series, the film series "Emmanuelle", several Bond movie spoofs, TV guest appearances, provided voice for several animated movies and series, and several Hong Kong action films, using his martial arts expertise.', dob = '1939-09-05', photo_url = 'https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/c2Sb2SYKhvwoq0MYrwpNTVuw6xH.jpg'

    SET biography = N'Gabriele Ferzetti (born Pasquale Ferzetti; 17 March 1925 – 2 December 2015) was an Italian actor with more than 160 credits across film, television, and stage. His career was at its peak in the 1950s and 1960s.

Ferzettinulls first leading role was in the film Lo Zappatore (1950). He portrayed Puccini twice in the films Puccini (1953) and Casa Ricordi (1954). He made his international breakthrough in Michelangelo Antonioninulls controversial LnullAvventura (1960) as a restless playboy. After a series of romantic performances, he acquired a reputation in Italy as an elegant, debonair, and somewhat aristocratic looking leading man.

Ferzetti starred as Lot in John Hustonulls biblical epic, The Bible: In the Beginning... (1966), and played railroad baron Morton in Sergio Leonenulls Once Upon a Time in the West (1968). Perhaps his best known role, internationally, was in the James Bond movie On Her Majestynulls Secret Service (1969) as Marc Ange Draco, although his voice was dubbed by British actor David de Keyser. He was perhaps best known to non-mainstream audiences for his role as the psychiatrist, Hans, in Liliana Cavaninulls The Night Porter (1974). In the 1970s, he appeared in a significant number of crime films, often as an inspector.

He appeared in Julia and Julia, opposite Laurence Olivier in Inchon (1982), and the cult film, First Action Hero. Later in his career, he played the role of Nono in the TV series Une famille formidable, while also appearing in Luca Guadagninonulls 2009 film I Am Love.

Ferzetti died on 2 December 2015, aged 90.

    SET biography = N'Louis Daniel Armstrong (August 4, 1901 – July 6, 1971), nicknamed Satchmo or Pops, was an American jazz trumpeter and singer from New Orleans, Louisiana.

Coming to prominence in the 1920s as an "inventive" cornet and trumpet player, Armstrong was a foundational influence in jazz, shifting the musicnulls focus from collective improvisation to solo performance.

With his instantly recognizable deep and distinctive gravelly voice, Armstrong was also an influential singer, demonstrating great dexterity as an improviser, bending the lyrics and melody of a song for expressive purposes. He was also greatly skilled at scat singing, vocalizing using sounds and syllables instead of actual lyrics.

Renowned for his charismatic stage presence and voice almost as much as for his trumpet-playing, Armstrongnulls influence extends well beyond jazz music, and by the end of his career in the 1960s, he was widely regarded as a profound influence on popular music in general.

Armstrong was one of the first truly popular African-American entertainers to "cross over," whose skin-color was secondary to his amazing talent in an America that was severely racially divided. It allowed him socially acceptable access to the upper echelons of American society that were highly restricted for a person of color. While he rarely publicly politicized his race, often to the dismay of fellow African-Americans, he was privately a huge supporter of the Civil Rights movement in America.', dob = '1901-08-04', photo_url = 'https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/3aYh8VEyvNB4Fj1OwAtty9bwMUv.jpg'

Shorter was born in North Vancouver, British Columbia. He initially studied jazz in college before switching to music composition.

Shorter created the score for an independent film, Come Together, in Vancouver. He went on to create music for several more films in the Vancouver area, including Neill Blomkamp nulls short Alive in Joburg.

Shorter was asked to create a score for Blomkampnulls 2009 science fiction film District 9, "something nullraw and darknull but which maintained its African roots". The resulting music has been described by reviewers as "rhythmic" and "magnificent", as "mournful ethnic-action strains", and as having "pseudo-exotic ambiance as a post-modern theme of loss". The sound track was released separately as a CD.

In 2014 Shorter wrote the score for the action film Pompeii. He subsequently composed music for the television series The Expanse and Colony.

    SET biography = N'Alison Doody (born November 11, 1966) is an Irish actress and model. She is the youngest of three children. She was educated in a convent, where she gained a passion for the arts. She later studied at the National College of Fine Arts in Dublin, but left because she lacked the motivation and thought she would take a year off to think it out. Meanwhile, while sitting in a café with friends, she was approached by a still photographer who asked her if she would be interested to model. Thinking she could use the pocket money, she said yes. Modeling proved to be both fun and lucrative, and very soon she did it professionally. Her modeling contracts led to commercial work, which would take her around the world. One day, a casting director saw her work and suggested she try acting instead. She was sent to London at age 19, where she quickly won an audition to appear in the new James Bond film, A View to a Kill (1985). She so loved acting that she pursued a career in that direction. After her first film, she shot a few TV dramas in London and in Dublin, but her big break came when she was cast as Austrian seductress Dr. Elsa Schneider in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989). Apparently she made a huge impression on Steven Spielberg and George Lucas, who loved her great sense of humor and her Grace Kelly looks. After Indiana Jones, which introduced her to Hollywood and to the United States, she was chosen to replace Cybill Shepherd as spokeswoman for LnullOréal. After that she shot a few B-movies in the United States, but at one point felt she missed Ireland too much, so she went back to Dublin. In 1994, she put her career on hold to spend more time with media heir Gavin OnullReilly, whom she had been dating for two years. In 1996 they married, and later had two children. In 2002, she was asked to cameo in the nullMichael Caine (I)_ comedy Les acteurs (2003), and there she regained a lust for the movie industry. The following summer, she shot Allan Quatermain et la pierre des ancêtres (2004) with co-starPatrick Swayze, and itnulls then that the whole ball started rolling again. In 2005, she and her husband divorced and she decided to re-launch her stalled career, but she quickly realized how difficult it was to break into this kind of business for a second time, especially after ten years away from the camera. Recently she appeared in the short film Benjaminulls Struggle (2005), directed by newcomer James Breese, and played a role in the well-known British series Meurtres en sommeil (2000). In a recent interview, she said she was thrilled to be acting again, but added that she wasnullt willing to accept anything for the sake of working. She is determined to find the right part, but she also wants to do different things: "Inullm fed up playing the nasty Nazi. Inulld like to do something quite extreme."', dob = '1966-11-11', photo_url = 'https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/m6LFIXUtjnyV2HTeITWLvNePkVX.jpg'

(Though several sources suggest he was born in Aberdeen, Scotland). He was the stepson of Henry Pownall, as his father, Captain John Gray, was killed in Iraq close to the time of his birth.  John Willoughby Gray served with distinction during the Second World War with GHQ Liaison Regiment (Phantom). For most of the campaign in Europe he commanded a patrol with 11th Armoured Division. For his gallant and distinguished services in the North West Europe campaign, he was appointed MBE. His recommendation reads:  "Captain Gray has commanded a divisional patrol with outstanding success throughout the campaign. The resource and initiative shown by him at all times has resulted in a great deal of vital information reaching Army and Corps HQ much more quickly than would otherwise have been the case, In addition, he has shown great enterprise and complete disregard for his own personal safety on many occasions, notably whilst carrying out reconnaissances in the Antwerp area during the advance through Belgium. The bearing of this officer under arduous conditions and his cheerfulness and willingness to do any work delegated to him unhesitatingly have been an example to those with whom he came in contact."  He achieved popularity in the mid-1950s after making 38 appearances on the television series The Adventures of Robin Hood. He appeared as nullPetenull in Harold Pinternulls The Birthday Party on its very first run in 1958, this being just one of countless stage performances he made. Though over-shadowed by his stage career, Gray made a handful of incredibly popular films, notably as a priest in Laurence Oliviernulls film Richard III (1955), The Mummy (1959), Absolution (1978), The Hit(1984), the James Bond film A View to a Kill (1985) as retired Nazi doctor and Max Zorin (Christopher Walken) henchman Karl Mortner/Hans Glaub,[1] and as the elderly and kind king in The Princess Bride (1987).  In the late 1980s, he appeared in the BBC drama Howardsnull Way as banker Sir John Stevens.  In Sergei Bondarchuknulls 1970 film Waterloo, he is credited as both an actor (playing Captain Ramsey) and a military consultant.[2]  Gray died aged 76 in February 1993.

Walter Gotell (15 March 1926 – 5 May 1997) was a German actor, known for his role as General Gogol, head of the KGB, in the James Bond film series.

Gotell was born in Bonn, Germany; his family emigrated to the United Kingdom after the Nazis came to power. A fluent English speaker, he started in films as early as 1943, usually playing German henchmen, such as in We Dive at Dawn (1943).

He began to have more established roles by the early fifties, starring in The African Queen (1951), Ice-Cold in Alex (1958), The Guns of Navarone (1961), 55 Days At Peking (1963), Lancelot and Guinevere (1963), The Spy Who Came In From The Cold (1965), Lord Jim (1965), Black Sunday (1977), The Boys From Brazil (1978), and Cuba (1979).

Gotell won the role of KGB General Anatol Gogol in The Spy Who Loved Me for being a look-alike of the former head of Soviet secret police Lavrentiy Pavlovitch Beria. His first role in the James Bond films came in 1963, when he played the henchman Morzeny in From Russia with Love. Starting in the late 1970s, he played the recurring role of General Gogol in the James Bond series, beginning with The Spy Who Loved Me in 1977. The character returned in Moonraker (1979), For Your Eyes Only (1981), Octopussy (1983), A View to a Kill (1985) and The Living Daylights (1987). As the Cold War developed, the role of leader of the KGB was seen to change attitudes to the West - from direct competitor to collaborator. His final appearance, as the Cold War began to become less imminent, sees him transferred to a different, more diplomatic role. Gotell is one of a few actors to have played a villain and a Bond ally in the film series (others being Joe Don Baker, Charles Gray and Richard Kiel).

Throughout his career, Gotell also made numerous guest appearances in a wide array of television series. He played Chief Constable Cullen in Softly, Softly: Taskforce between 1969 and 1975. He guested in many series including Danger Man, Knight Rider, The A-Team, Airwolf, The X-Files, Scarecrow and Mrs. King, MacGyver, Star Trek: The Next Generation, Miami Vice, Cagney and Lacey, The Saint, and many others.

He also notched up a number of film appearances including A View To A Kill, Eat the Rich (he also cameos in Motorhead’s music video soundtrack of the film) and Willow. However, it is his role as Big Ron in the BBC soap opera Eastenders that Tarr is best remembered.  He played the friendly ducking and diving market trader Big Ron from the show’s inception in 1985 to just before his untimely death from cancer at the age of 60 in October 1997. Although he was only a supporting actor and therefore his character had very few central storylines, he was often seen interacting with the main characters in the show who could always rely on his physically intimidating presence whenever trouble was brewing. After his death, he appeared in pre-recorded episodes of the soap. To explain the absence of his character, in early 1998 Big Ron was written out of the series in a storyline concerning him winning the lottery and moving to Spain.', dob = '1936-11-14', photo_url = 'https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/iMSzEgb5VCREfDQjtxo9cI0wYt5.jpg'

    SET biography = N'Rémy Julienne (17 April 1930 – 21 January 2021) was a French driving stunt performer and coordinator, assistant director and occasional actor. He was also a rallycross champion and 1956 French motorcross champion.

Julienne was born in 1930, the son of café owners in the town of Cepoy, 110 km south-east of Paris. During World War II, he was dared by children evacuated from Paris to ride a bicycle across the local canal, which inspired him to start riding motocross.

In his early 20nulls Julienne became French motocross champion in 1957, which brought him to the attention of eminent stunt co-coordinator Gil Delamare. Through Delamare, Juliennenulls first screen appearance in 1964 was replacing actor Jean Marais, and in 1966 he played a German army motorcyclist in La Grande Vadrouille.

After Delamarenulls tragic death during a stunt in 1966, Julienne stepped-in and agreed to fulfill contracts Delamare had signed with various film studios. Juliennenulls scientific approach which created spectacular on-screen images garnered him admiration within the industry in an age before computer modelling. Working initially in French film and TV, and occasional Hollywood films shot in Europe, his developing reputation led to his employment on the British film The Italian Job. Producer Michael Deeley later commented that “During our initial meeting with Rémy, Peter Collinson [the film’s director] and I were delighted to discover that he was prepared to take the chase sequence even further than we had envisaged, suggesting a different range of hair-raising stunts that could be written into the script.” Julienne planned and co-ordinated all of the vehicle sequences, including the epic Mini chase sequence through the streets and roof tops of Turin.

"Very often people ask, ‘what was my favourite stunt?’ I’d say the jump between the two Fiat factory roofs must be the one, because it was emotional, because it was difficult. We worked on the ground, we prepared the ramps, calculated distances, speeds etc. [Originally] it was decided I had to do three separate jumps in each Mini. I explained that, as the roof was very wide, we could make the three Minis jump all together… it looked much better as a shot. It was more complicated, but really amazing."

He resultantly became Hollywoodnulls go-to vehicle stunt coordinator, best publicly known for his stunts on six James Bond films, five of which were directed by John Glen. Julienne became known for Bond sequences which made ordinary cars do extraordinary things, such as the Citroen 2CV in For Your Eyes Only, the Renault 11 in A View to a Kill, and the petrol semi-tanker in Licence to Kill in which a Kenworth performed a wheelie. "The tanker chase was the most dangerous sequence I ever devised” said Glen, who also noted that Julienne was fastidious in his preparation. ...

    SET biography = N'Steven Allan Spielberg (born December 18, 1946) is an American filmmaker. A major figure of the New Hollywood era and pioneer of the modern blockbuster, Spielberg is widely regarded as one of the greatest film directors of all time and is the most commercially successful director in film history. Several of Spielbergnulls works are considered among the greatest films in history, and some are among the highest-grossing films ever.

Spielberg was born in Cincinnati, Ohio, and grew up in Phoenix, Arizona. He moved to California and studied film in college. After directing several episodes for television, including Night Gallery and Columbo, he directed the film Duel (1971), which Barry Diller approved. He made his theatrical debut with The Sugarland Express (1974) and became a household name with the summer blockbuster Jaws (1975). He directed more escapist box office successes with Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977), E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982) and the original Indiana Jones trilogy (1981–1989). He explored drama in The Color Purple (1985) and Empire of the Sun (1987).

In 1993, Spielberg directed the science fiction thriller Jurassic Park, the highest-grossing film ever, and the epic historical drama Schindlernulls List, which has often been listed as one of the greatest films ever made. He won the Academy Award for Best Director for the latter and the World War II epic Saving Private Ryan (1998). Spielberg has since directed the science fiction films A.I. Artificial Intelligence (2001), Minority Report (2002), War of the Worlds (2005) and Ready Player One (2018); the historical dramas Amistad (1997), Munich (2005), War Horse (2011), Lincoln (2012), Bridge of Spies (2015) and The Post (2017); the comedies Catch Me if You Can (2002), and The Terminal (2004); the animated film The Adventures of Tintin (2011); the musical West Side Story (2021); and the family drama The Fabelmans (2022).

Spielberg co-founded Amblin Entertainment and DreamWorks and has produced many successful films and television series, including Poltergeist (1982), Gremlins (1984), Back to the Future (1985), Who Framed Roger Rabbit (1988), and Band of Brothers (2001). He has also collaborated extensively with the composer John Williams, with whom he has worked on all but five of his feature films.

Among other accolades, he has received three Academy Awards, four Golden Globe Awards and two BAFTA Awards, as well as the AFI Life Achievement Award in 1995, the Knight Commander of the British Empire in 2001, the Kennedy Center Honor in 2006, the Cecil B. DeMille Award in 2009 and the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2015. Seven of his films have been inducted into the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as "culturally, historically or aesthetically significant". In 2013, Time listed him as one of the 100 most influential people, and in 2023, Spielberg was the recipient of the first-ever 100 Impact Award in the US.', dob = '1946-12-18', photo_url = 'https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/tZxcg19YQ3e8fJ0pOs7hjlnmmr6.jpg'

    SET biography = N'John Michael Crichton (/ˈkraɪtən/; October 23, 1942 – November 4, 2008) was an American author, screenwriter and filmmaker. His books have sold over 200 million copies worldwide, and over a dozen have been adapted into films. His literary works heavily feature technology and are usually within the science fiction, techno-thriller, and medical fiction genres. Crichtonulls novels often explore human technological advancement and attempted dominance over nature, both with frequently catastrophic results; many of his works are cautionary tales, especially regarding themes of biotechnology. Several of his stories centre on themes of genetic modification, hybridisation, palaeontology and/or zoology. Many features have medical or scientific underpinnings, reflective of his medical training.

Crichton received an MD from Harvard Medical School in 1969 but did not practice medicine, instead choosing to focus on his writing. Initially writing under a pseudonym, he eventually published 25 novels in his lifetime, including: The Andromeda Strain (1969), The Terminal Man (1972), The Great Train Robbery (1975), Congo (1980), Sphere (1987), Jurassic Park (1990), Rising Sun (1992), Disclosure (1994), The Lost World (1995), Airframe (1996), Timeline (1999), Prey (2002), State of Fear (2004), and Next (2006). Four more novels, in various stages of completion, were published after he died in 2008.

Crichton was also involved in the film and television industry. In 1973, he wrote and directed Westworld, the first film to use 2D computer-generated imagery. He also directed Coma (1978), The First Great Train Robbery (1978), Looker (1981), and Runaway (1984). He was the creator of the television series ER (1994–2009), and several of his novels were adapted into films, most notably the Jurassic Park franchise.

Despite the often behind-the-scenes nature of his work, Chuck Finch has been praised by prominent cinematographers for his artistry and dependability. Seamus McGarvey described him as “one of the rare gaffers who is as happy on a tiny set, painting with a few small light sources, as he is on a huge stage with thousands of lights.” He praised how “he treats everything as one… he knows the story and helps the light fuse with it.” John Mathieson recalled working with Finch on Kingdom of Heaven (2005): they spent 144 days filming in the Moroccan desert, lighting a quarter-mile wall and managing thousands of extras and massive cavalry scenes. Even in such high-pressure circumstances, Finch “didn’t complain once” and provided steady confidence to the team. His combination of affability, discipline, and clarity—being “very social… but when he raises his voice and says he wants the set cleared, people listen”—makes him a much-sought gaffer on both sides of the Atlantic.

In 2006, Chuck Finch was honoured with the Michael Balcon Award (Outstanding British Contribution to Cinema) at the BAFTA Awards, a prestigious recognition of his outstanding service to the film industry. His extensive body of work, collaborative spirit, and technical excellence solidify his reputation as one of the foremost gaffers in contemporary cinema.', dob = null, photo_url = null
